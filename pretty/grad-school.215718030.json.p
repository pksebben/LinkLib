However, I think it should only include major software efforts that you led and not just one-off contributions to packages. Add an explanatory note describing what you did and e.g. why it\u2019s a big deal and what skills did it build for your career. If you feel like you want to add one-off contributions, consider just briefly listing projects you\u2019ve contributed to.</p>",
