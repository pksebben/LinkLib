But I have had a very similar situation in the past with a neutral employer, who ended up playing hardball. I'd recommend if possible to just ride it out until the actual vest date, the moment you send an email stating your intention to leave, that counts as your \"notice\" and your employer is not obliged to be charitable after that. What did you end up doing?</p>",
