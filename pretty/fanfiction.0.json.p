He's focused really hard on the juggling, and you can tell because he's doing that face where you stick out your tongue to show that you're focusing really hard. The balls are stars now instead of typical juggling balls like they were before. The camera zooms in, a closeup on one of the stars. It's a fire planet, full of fire star people, who dance and skip and run around. Little flames make their houses, and all their furniture is fire. A Father Flame returns home from a day at 1950s work, and his hat is fire. Everything is fire, but no one is hurt, because fire cannot hurt fire. No one fights, because fire cannot fight fire. A world on fire is the most peaceful world, in this case.</p>",
