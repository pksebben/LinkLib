The centerpiece of the space is practitioners like you, and is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice of responsible AI -- to inform research with actual practitioners\u2019 insights and to inform practitioners with existing tools based on current literature. (hats off to <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/ml-irl-2020/home\">ML-IRL</a>!)</p>\n<p>In this space, we are aiming to create a nuanced conversation, grounded by lessons-learned and case studies based on real world examples of development, deployment and integration of AI from various sectors (gov, humanitarian, commercial tech, medical, etc.)  driven by practitioners. The conversation is not just about technical methodologies but rather about the process and negotiations that took place. For the details, please see <a href=\"https://kiwakosakamoto.medium.com/introducing-the-ai-irl-space-at-mozfest-2021-ade1fff124a9\">this blog post</a>. I sincerely hope you will submit a session to share your experience and knowledge, even for a small example. <strong>Even if you don\u2019t have a specific session design right now, if you simply indicate your background and the topic(s) you want to share in your proposal, we may be able to work with you to design a session together or combine your session with others based on domains/topics during the curation period.</strong> We especially welcome examples outside of North American context.</p>\n<p>We also welcome ML trainers and educators from the global community to share their lessons-learned, as well as the researchers and developers to give demo/tutorials on their tools and methodologies on broader Trustworthy AI topics.</p>\n<p><strong>The deadline for <a href=\"https://pretalx.com/mozfest-2021/cfp\">the CFP</a> is November 23.</strong></p>\n<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at <a href=\"mailto:kiwako@mozillafestival.org\">kiwako@mozillafestival.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Kiwako</p>",
