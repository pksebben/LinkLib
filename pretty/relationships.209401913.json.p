Pre-covid, non-nesting-partner and I had had an agreement for 2 nights a week, plus a weekend every now and then. Even though the subway is being cleaned more than ever, none of us likes the idea of me getting on 2 trains 4 times a week. My partner has a car, but tolls and parking add up, and they would be sleeping on a pull out couch if they visited. </p>\n<p>It hurts to say that we might not be able to see each other every week for the foreseeable future, but it seems that organizing longer trips less frequently makes more sense.</p>",
