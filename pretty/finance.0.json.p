            "content": "<p>There is a lot of (vague) information about Robin Hood\u2019s revenue model online. Their own website is a good starting point: <a href=\"https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001226106-How-Robinhood-Makes-Money\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001226106-How-Robinhood-Makes-Money\">https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001226106-How-Robinhood-Makes-Money</a>.</p>\n<p>The most controversial practice they take part in is something called payment for order flow, which is when high frequency trading firms pay Robin Hood to route your order to them. WSJ has a pretty good intro: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001</a>.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that trading always has a cost. It can be difficult to know what that cost is because part of it is baked into the execution. In other words, maybe the \u201creal\u201d* fair price per share at the moment you traded was $50.10, but the price you paid was $50.11.  This is called slippage and it happens all the time, even to big sophisticated players. There can also be other, opaque things going on between when your order gets to your broker and when it gets executed, like payment for order flow.</p>\n<p>Fidelity may charge you higher commissions than Robin Hood, but your trades there may have less slippage. Or maybe not. If you trade a lot, you attempt to track this. If you trade infrequently, it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much to you.</p>\n<p>One thing to consider is that the impact of flat commissions depends on how large your trades are: a $5.95 commission is relatively more painful if you trade 5 shares than 5,000 shares. So Robin Hood\u2019s relative appeal is probably higher for people placing lots of small trades.</p>\n<p>*(The \u201creal\u201d is in quotes because it\u2019s theoretical).</p>",

The idea is that, in bulk, the retail flow doesn't contain any information: there are about as many buy orders as there are sell orders. This means a market maker can their spread with little risk. If you are very price sensitive, they offer limit buy sand sells as well as market orders. I've traded options on robinhood and found it to be alright. I don't know of any other broker that offers commission-free options trading, but I haven't looked recently. I used to trade with IB. They are commissions based but give you a lot of control over where your orders go, and access to many other markets.</p>",

There's noise in the exchange rate. This is just the stock market problem, minus the secular trend, which removes any market exposure arguments. You want to minimize the variance in the number of EUR you have. In this framing, every currency transaction increases the final variance, and so you want to minimize unnecessary transactions. Averaging 10 samples of the exchange rate will yield lower variance than just 1 sample, assuming those samples are independently distributed. (if you wait a month in between transactions, this i.i.d assumption isn't that bad. obviously doesn't work if you make these transactions minutes after each other.). </p>\n<p>So I think after having considered the currency exchange example, the place I disagree with dan's argument is the assertion that $X cash == $X stock market, because it ignores the variance incurred by making that transaction</p>",

Are you now in a riskier position if you convert your stock into cash and simultaneously convert all of your cash into stock? Do you have less risk if you DCA when you do that? How can this be?</p>\n<p>If you don't like this example, say you take $X in stock and you convert to cash and then immediately convert it back to stock. Is this riskier than never having done this (assuming everything is frictionless and instantaneous, etc.)? The claim I'm responding to is that you take on risk when you make either of these transactions, but it's not the transaction that \"creates\" risk here.</p>\n<p>Your currency argument is based around wanting to minimize the variance when you convert X to Y. Do you want this in both directions and why?</p>\n<p>Say you're going hold EUR for a two years for some reason, you should DCA for one year on your way in and on your way out? Also, how does this compare to just leaving half your holding in USD and converting half to EUR.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I disagree with dan's argument is the assertion that $X cash == $X stock market,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just to clear, you're saying if you have $X in cash, this is different from having $X in the stock market and turning it into $X in cash? How does the $X behave differently if it \"came from\" the stock market?</p>\n<p>And yes, your variance is reduced with DCA. Another strategy that would reduce your variance would be to invest 80% of your money and leave 20% as cash. I'm not arguing your variance isn't reduced (this seems obvious?), just that there's no magic happening.</p>\n<p>For a practical example, say you're at a company that still has annual vesting (MS was like this with the initial grant a few years ago, not sure if they still are). When you get your annual lump sum of MS stock, should you immediately sell it and convert it into whatever your investment holdings are or should you DCA and slowly do the conversion over the duration of a year? Your currency/variance argument applies to this -- if you DCA, you reduce the variance w.r.t. your holding of MS stock, but I think that most people don't argue that you should do this (outside of a psychological thing where people feel bad if they sell vested stock and then it goes up a bunch, but the exact same thing could happen if you receive your lump sum of cash and don't buy company stock, but it would be very unusual to argue that you should take your cash bonus and buy company stock to avoid feeling bad if the stock goes up).</p>",

Hence, a fair comparison requires a means of adjusting for risk and making the two policies comparable in risk. This can be done by appropriately reducing the amount of dollars invested in the [lump-sum] approach.\" [ <a href=\"https://jpm.iijournals.com/content/20/2/45\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://jpm.iijournals.com/content/20/2/45\">https://jpm.iijournals.com/content/20/2/45</a> ]</p>\n<p>but the reframing arguments are useful too. I'll add this to dan's reframing: if you've already decided you're comfortable with a certain asset allocation (and thus a certain risk-return tradeoff) for the long-term, dollar-cost averaging is really a way of saying \"I'm not really comfortable with that asset allocation -- yet\". so the best argument for it is more psychological than mathematical; that you're gradually discovering your real risk appetite by seeing what it feels like to be exposed to the market.</p>",

That said, if you just want to tinker around a bit and learn about market structure, this could be a good way to do it. Or maybe you have a strategy with a longer time horizon, and are therefore are less sensitive to poor execution. Regarding Python: if you aren\u2019t super performance-sensitive, there\u2019s no reason not to use Python for your models. There\u2019s lots of Python in finance.</p>",

            "content": "<p>I can explain the type of arbitrage I did in the above Github link, in case it is helpful:</p>\n<p>I focused on the arbitrage of assets within an exchange. All of the assets on the exchange have (seemingly) random fluctuations in price throughout the day, as people trade willy-nilly.  Because people only tend to look at what the price is directly between assets (i.e. people might only look at the dollar to euro conversion if they were trading dollars for euros), and ignore \"indirect\" prices (i.e. people wouldn't look at the net conversion rate if they were to first trade dollars for yen, and then yen for euro), sometimes opportunities exist to make profits off of the indirect prices. For example, sometimes it might be the case that you trade dollars for yen, and then yen for euro, and then euro back to dollars, and end up with more dollars than you start with, due to the random market fluctuations and the fact that people don't tend to check these indirect prices. Often, these types of opportunities are rare because of trading fees, and because of the market spreads, but the opportunities do exist. So arbitrage is basically calculating the indirect prices of everything and executing the trades if you find one which would be profitable.  I believe this is what was referenced in previous messages in this stream above - the problem is that you have to be REALLY invested and optimized for this strategy to be profitable since people trade with very expensive infrastructure and on the order of milliseconds. This executing based only on the instantaneous prices is what I meant by \"pure\" arbitrage.  The arbitrage bot I included was by no means profitable and was just a project aimed at understanding the markets. </p>\n<p>A statistical arbitrage strategy might take into account the correlations between markets, and thus would not need to execute in milliseconds to be profitable; knowing how the changes in price for one asset impact the price of another a few seconds/minutes later would allow you to come up with a strategy that executes on larger time horizons.</p>\n<p>Hope that helps? I also know all of what I know by reading random internet articles and kind of venturing out by myself, so this explanation might just be totally wrong.</p>",

The USA's economy is perhaps the most diversified in the world and relatively easy to invest in. Global reserve currency. Our companies have cash flows everywhere, selling and investing globally. Favorable regulations, tax environment, and fiscal stimulus. Also monetary stimulus, but no inflation. A great court system, and little corruption. Yes, a bit deindustrialized, but invested in industry abroad. It's pretty amazing, perhaps exceptional, all things considered. Yes debt is rising, but Japan has way more debt and they are fine. There are a lot of reasons to be concerned, but those reasons apply many other places too, and plenty of reasons to be optimistic, many of which don't apply to places that seem better along other dimensions.</p>",
