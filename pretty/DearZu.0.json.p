The primary thinking is that we want it to feel warm and like it's coming from real people -- which it is! Part of the goal of Still Computing in general, and Dear Zu in particular, is to give people a taste of what the RC community is like and the value of getting to join that community for life. This can be really hard to imagine, especially for people beyond the range of our word of mouth networks, who aren't already connected to RC in some way or don't know anyone who's done a batch. </p>\n<p>We're going to hopefully field a wide range of questions that we find interesting for different reasons. I'd say, if you feel tricky about a particular question, to just err on the side of not responding to that one. If you feel you have something important to contribute on a subject that's touchy for you, or if you realize after writing out a response that you don't want it linked to your name, you can make a note at the top of the post that you'd like to anonymize that response. In that case, we'll attribute it to an anonymous Recurser. We hope totally anonymous responses will be the exception, though.</p>",

When I came to RC I wanted to try to manage that, knowing I'd be in an environment where ideas would come to me easily but I'd also have unique access to deep knowledge and the time to pursue it. Although the instinct to start in a new direction never subsided, I made myself keep to one main project per week, regularly returning to previous weeks' ideas to dig deeper into them, occasionally giving myself room to try something different. It felt like it worked, resulting in three deeper projects and a dozen shallower ones, all of which brought me new lessons. Since leaving RC I've found more motivation to continue pursuing my ideas over a longer period and expect to keep growing in that area. <span aria-label=\"triumph\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f624\" role=\"img\" title=\"triumph\">:triumph:</span> <span aria-label=\"nerd\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f913\" role=\"img\" title=\"nerd\">:nerd:</span></p>",

            "content": "<p>ok! that makes sense, especially since he linked to that post. here's my answer, then:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I think time zones are <em>fascinating</em>. It's easy to find loads of articles or videos full of people complaining about the arbitrariness of time zones, the odd exceptions to \"whole number offsets of UTC\", the times when countries changed their time zone or their approach to Daylight Savings Time, the concept of DST itself, etc. But i personally think that all this betrays the nature of time zones: <em>Time zones are a mechanical reflection of a fully human, culturally-agreed practice.</em></p>\n<p>The reason i say that time zones reflect culture is because of the little exceptions that other people tend to rag on. Yes, Samoa switched from UTC-11 to UTC+13 and skipped the entire day of 2011-12-30. This was because they were less culturally attached to America than they were when the original time zone was decided, and they wanted to reflect the fact that they were now culturally (and financially) much closer to Australia and New Zealand. Yes, China is all set to UTC+8, even though mainland China stretches across three or four time-zone-widths of land. This is because of the cultural impetus of the One China policy, and the Communist Party's attempts to create cultural unity within the vast country. (Also, if i remember right, people in western China tend to keep separate clocks on a time zone that's closer to their actual location, so that sunrise/sunset are closer to \"natural\" times that the rest of the world experiences them in.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps my favorite example of time zones reflecting culture is the unofficial time zone of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia#Anomalies\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia#Anomalies\">Australian Central Western Standard Time</a>. A handful of small towns on the southern highway in Australia collectively decided to split the difference between Australian Western Standard Time (UTC+8) and Australian Central Standard Time (UTC+9:30) to create a sort of rogue time zone of UTC+<strong>8:45</strong>! The reason i call this a \"rogue time zone\" is because it's completely unofficial in terms of being recognized by Australian law (though there are official road signs that declare the time zone), but it still managed to sneak its way into time zone databases! You can set your computer to <code>Australia/Eucla</code>, and you'll join this rogue time zone yourself! (This is all the more remarkable when you consider that AWCST itself is only home to about 200 people. I think it's cool that it's accommodated in the global time zone databases.)</p>\n<p>This is all to say that time zones are messy (and time in general is messy) because <em>the world</em> is messy. Even if you try to abolish time zones and get everyone on UTC, people are still going to set their clocks so that business hours are 8-5, and also occur when the sun is actually up (at least as best as you can do, latitude depending). Even if you try to abolish time zones and get everyone on UTC, you still have to deal with leap seconds, because the earth is as wibbly-wobbly as time is, and a year is not the same number of seconds long every time. The best you can do is to have enough warning when things change to update your systems, and try to accommodate people when they want to deviate from a tidy, sterile standard that doesn't fit their lived experience.</p>\n<p>(But as long as we're getting rid of time zones, we might as well convert to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time\">Swatch Internet Time</a>. <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span>)</p>",

I want to offer a defense of time zone abolition though <span aria-label=\"smiling devil\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f608\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiling devil\">:smiling_devil:</span> </p>\n<p>I think that piece is overthinking the relationship between time and how people plan. It's convenient now that solar noon is around 12:00 each day, but if I want to phone a friend in Helsinki, it would be easy to search \"when is solar noon in helsinki\" or \"when is sunrise in helsinki\" and get an answer back in UTC, which I would then easily understand from my current context with no translation. I don't need to look at a work schedule or webcam to get that info, every search engine does that already. eg <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sunrise+in+helsinki\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sunrise+in+helsinki\">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sunrise+in+helsinki</a></p>\n<p>The stated conflicts regarding norms around typical work, school, and sleep schedules already exist with current timekeeping practices. The piece makes a convincing argument that getting rid of time zones doesn't simplify everything about scheduling, which remains a tricky topic. But it does make specifying a specific interval of time simple, which is what clock time ought to do in my opinion. Now uncoupled from messy geography, we can build other more appropriate ways of talking about local schedules like work, prayer, school, and eating. Each of those can be respectively simple as well. The current system of overloading time with a ton of concepts is the source of much of the complexity presented in that piece.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the link <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"221814\">@Nathan Goldbaum (he) (S1'19)</span> , fun indeed <span aria-label=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f601\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>",

However, we <em>also</em> have to worry about GPS time, which drifts away from UTC very slowly -- there have been ~18 leap seconds, which are applied to UTC but not GPS. This shows up as subtly odd (or totally bogus) data products when you've applied the wrong offset.

If we ever think that we might care about the timezone/where something occurred, that data has to be captured explicitly instead of just UTC plus an offset. At a previous gig where we cared about time a lot (medical startup), we had sites with static physical locations so we could infer that information, but if it's ever relevant later (especially since political boundaries change, people change what timezones they're in, etc.) it's best to have the location information <em>in addition</em> to the temporal data.</p>\n<h3>Absolute vs. wall time</h3>\n<p>The other major issue we deal with is whether the time we care about is absolute (x seconds from Unix epoch, whatever) versus wall time ( 0900 tomorrow). This matters a lot to end users, because usually people think in terms of what the clock on the wall says, and that can give a different interpretation than if you abide by strictly \"5 hours from now\" sort of mindset. This gets even more important when people talk about dates instead of datetimes...reporting on two days of activity is a great example of this: many people would expect \"show me the last two days of activity\" to include the previous two solar days instead of literally the last 48 hours from time of query.</p>\n<p>Basically, I'd argue that future dates should be stored in wall time, and historical dates in absolute time, unless your problem domain is specifically about intervals of time (say, timing rocket flight or something where you already have your own timeline).</p>",

Time Zones are fascinating. Time is an incredibly complex concept that humans are constantly trying to build systems to explain. Reading through the history of tzdb shows how we are still learning all of the ways people used to deal with time, let alone how they deal with it now. Random countries change their minds because a new dictator comes into place, a small group decides it will interpret time differently. The great thing about all of these changes though is it doesn't change how everyone else understands it. Our global consensus on what time it is exists as long as you want to talk to someone not standing right next to you, which, hopefully we will never stop doing.</p>",

            "content": "<p>I've moved back and forth between manager and individual contributor roles in my career and loved both, but for different reasons. I really like Charity Major's take on this, <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/\">The Engineer/Manager Pendulum</a>. I also know plenty of people who tried management, didn't like it, and went back to engineering permanently with no long-term consequences\u2014it's OK to try it out and decide it's not for you.</p>\n<p>Management offers a lot of interesting challenges\u2014you are responsible for understanding your team (as individuals and a group), crafting an environment where they can excel, learning how to give up authority over something while retaining some responsibility for it (this is delegating; keeping the authority is micromanaging), recruiting people to your team, and learning how to work within the human ecosystem of your company/organization and balance the needs of your team and others. I found mentoring and coaching others on their career paths and giving valuable feedback to be some of the most rewarding work I've ever done. If you're at all interested in helping other humans grow, I recommend trying management.</p>\n<p>It also differs from engineering in ways that can be a bit of a shell-shock. Management isn't nearly as project-based as traditional engineering work; I still had major projects I worked on from time to time as a manager (like designing a review process), but a lot of my work was more interrupt driven and ephemeral. This means management has a lot of downtime; just like with engineering there can be high-stress and intensity periods, but when everything is quiet, it can be unclear what exactly you're supposed to <em>do</em>.  A common failure case here is to try doing engineering work; the high-intensity periods make it hard to have the same day-to-day context as your ICs, and you have an explicit authority which changes the way people interact with you whether you want it to or not. The downtime is really just for maintaining your relationships with your team and management peers and keeping an eye out for what's coming up.</p>\n<p>Depending on the circumstances you're being moved to management in, you might have really great resources or nothing at all. For me, my first time being a manager was something of a battlefield promotion\u2014my manager quit, I got their job, I had no one directly managing me for a month because the whole organization was a little jostled, and I wasn't given any explicit training. This is unfortunately common and can be pretty scary. The change to being a manager doesn't feel so dramatic at first, but it drastically reduces the release valves you have at work. Coworkers may have been your social outlet before, but ranting to your teammates isn't a healthy thing anymore\u2014your frustrations will become their fears. It's really good to build an external support group. I joined a <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/\">public Slack organization dedicated to engineering leadership</a> and went to a number of management meetups, as well as socializing with friends who had gone through it. I think without those I would have drowned; if I have one major takeaway from all my time managing, it's this.</p>\n<p>Being a manager isn't the only way to advance in your career. In the organizations I've seen the insides of, a first-time manager has less power than a senior IC. Do this because you're interested in the work, but if you are interested, don't worry about having it all under control at first. It's a very different job, and it takes time to get comfortable.</p>",

            "content": "<p>One of the ways I view it, which helps reveal a false dichotomy in creating a hard-line separation between an \"engineer\" v/s a \"manager\" (explained below):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Engineering\" is programming <em>thingware</em> --- hardware/software (eco)systems, and </li>\n<li>\"Engineering + Management\" is programming <em>humanware</em> --- people and organizational (eco)systems. Not in the social engineering sense, but in the \"devise systems, processes, escape valves, feedback mechanisms\" to engender excellence and growth of people one manages/leads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Abstractly</strong></p>\n<p>There are surprising overlaps between the two \"wares\". </p>\n<p>All workflow problems are the same, for example --- requiring some combination of queues, buffers, contention management to achieve throughput / speed / foobarbaz tradeoff. The thingware solution to a workflow problem concerns itself with constraints of the thing-system (caches, cores, concurrency, clocks etc.), whereas the humanware solution must account for the oddities of human systems (capacity, fatigue, emotion, coordination, knowledge/skill asymmetries etc.).</p>\n<p>While the substrates are entirely different, the architectural approaches to problem-solving are quite similar.</p>\n<p>Having been on both sides of the table, I feel the observant engineer will find a lot of their existing understanding can port over to people management and direction. One has to squint the right way and adjust one's mindset to far slower <em>and non-deterministic</em> human-time feedback cycles than compiler errors and pager duty alerts :-)</p>\n<p><strong>Perspective matters deeply</strong> </p>\n<p>To quote Alan Kay, <em>\u201cA change of perspective is worth 80 IQ points.\u201d</em>.</p>\n<p>And so, when in a specific management situation (design teams, product management, tech, business, marketing) I find myself consuming as much <em>contextually related</em> management literature as I can, so I may test the merits of those perspectives against the unforgiving touchstone of hard reality.</p>\n<p>Perspective also helps me temper my personal mental makeup. I'm quick to anger, tend to be an idealist, and can negotiate aggressively. Everybody has some demon they need to tame. These are mine. Learning about other peoples approaches and struggles helps me course correct and make amends when I go wrong. I've made several public gaffes and public apologies in the organisations I've worked at, and have found people that suffer or hurt by my hand somehow still appear to respect me eventually. People can be forgiving, whereas thingware couldn't care less :-)</p>\n<p><strong>Concretely</strong></p>\n<p>For me, <strong>a toolbox approach is vital</strong> to success as a manager... To learn how all kinds of people solved management dilemmas in all kinds of contexts, and make the references part of my \"starter kit\" catalogue, which then helps me start reasoning about some situation that is happening $Today at $Work with $PersonOrTeam. All  human problems that I will face have already happened and been addressed in various ways. Which way is judicious in my current context?</p>\n<p>Here are some books and essays---that I've read and/or reviewed for later reading---that I feel, inform one's views on general management, project/program management, organisation design and development, and systems thinking.</p>\n<p><em>Donald Reinertsen</em> <a href=\"http://reinertsenassociates.com/books/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://reinertsenassociates.com/books/\">http://reinertsenassociates.com/books/</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Managing the Design Factory</li>\n<li>Developing products in half the time</li>\n<li>He also has some good talks out there, for example:<br>\n** The Logic of Flow: Some Indispensable Concepts: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc1MqHsiiKo\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc1MqHsiiKo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc1MqHsiiKo</a><br>\n** Cost of Delay: Theory &amp; Practice with Donald Reinertsen: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmU5yIu7vRw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmU5yIu7vRw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmU5yIu7vRw</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Eliyahu M.

It cost the lives, blood, sweat and tears of many workers to limit the work day to 8 hours... In the 19th century. (According to wikipedia, work days typically ranged 10 to 16 hours, 6 days a week. Child labour was extremely common, including in the deadliest, most harrowing conditions like mining work, for example.) Why aren't we fighting for the 25 hours work week, a century later?

Most of the things below are ways of working towards achieving this goal.</li>\n<li>Responsiveness is key!  Aim to give a reply to every PR within 24 hours, even if it's just a thank-you-I'll-look-soon if your project is small.  Similar to what you'd do with customer support for a product you're launching.</li>\n<li>Have a chat tool like Zulip that you encourage contributors to join and ask questions.  I am obviously biased but Zulip saves me soooo much time doing this that I can still reply to every thread even if I do several hours of focus work at a time and even though we have like 50+ people doing stuff, since the UI makes replying later with a friendly, welcoming message a good experience for contributors.</li>\n</ul>",

Even if it's just a few friends, looking over people's shoulders while they try to get started with your software is incredibly informative about what's right and wrong with your tool's developer onboarding experience.  It's like a usability study for your developer experience.</li>\n<li>Plaster your website with encouragement to visit the chat, introduce oneself, and/or ask for help!  This helps you get opportunities to talk to your users/contributors.</li>\n<li>Write down what you learned from that experience and spend a bunch of time serializing that to issues at least.  In the early days, like 25% of the Zulip issue tracker was ideas for making the codebase or developer experience better -- they make great first issues!</li>\n<li>Look at the feedback you needed to give on pull requests.  See if you can make your tooling give most of that feedback instead (For Zulip, we did a ton of work on linting and testing to help with this.  The first N pull requests half the feedback was random style variations; now we don't spend much time on that because our tools help folks do it right the first time).</li>\n<li>Repeat until you feel like a person could stumble across your website and have a great experience without having to talk to you before their PR is submitted..</li>\n<li>When you're at a size where a summer intern would be interesting, doing Google Summer of Code is a great way to get dozens of students to test your onboarding experience.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've been meaning to write a giant essay blog post on this topic for the Zulip blog, since I have tons of things I'd like to say on the topic, but I can never find the time <span aria-label=\"frown\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f641\" role=\"img\" title=\"frown\">:frown:</span>.</p>",

This makes it hard to figure out what you can do to help out, while preserving the vision.</p>\n<p>For larger projects, I think that one of the best things that you can do to help here is to have a low overhead, relatively low latency place for people to discuss the project. The projects I'm working with tend to use IRC channels for this, but any sort of chat works.</p>\n<p>This gives a place for people to ask low overhead questions, and discuss the approach they want to take before proposing solutions . It allows iteration on the concepts to happen before any real investment occurs, which means that people are both more willing to make the investment, and aren't as bummed out if it turns out that their idea doesn't fit -- or maybe they even come away with an even better solution or approach to a problem.</p>\n<p>Having a contributing document, describing what you expect people to do and how, and is also worthwhile. If you're concerned about vision, spell out what you consider out of scope there, too.</p>\n<p>And, a small addendum on vision: I've not found this to be a problem. Many of my contributors seem to be more concerned about whether a change will fit into the project than I am, and more than once, that I've that a contributor had an idea for a more sweeping change that I think is a great idea, but they were holding back because they weren't sure how it'd fit.</p>",

I just wanted to contribute one little thing that I think I've arrived on, which can go a long way to these goals. It's to hold as a fundamental premise that everybody's use cases are valid. Sometimes it can take a little digging to figure out what someone's use case is. Perhaps they are asking for a new feature, that doesn't really make sense for you to add to your project. But it remains true that <em>their use case is valid</em>. If you can figure out what their use case is, then you can probably prescribe some actions they can take to solve their problem, which may or may not involve your open source project. For me, this mental model helps to avoid tense conversations, and frames things differently than \"accepting\" or \"rejecting\" a contribution. Rather, each contribution is a little mini mystery where you figure out what they're trying to do, and help them accomplish their goals in a way that works best for the project and the contributor.</p>",

            "content": "<p>I think the \"everybody's use cases are valid\" point that Andrew K made can be a trap for open source projects. This is coming from a perspective having been a part of a few very opinionated open source projects, namely Conjur and elementary OS. Of course with open source, people have the legal and moral right to use your software for whatever case they're interested in. You don't need to validate it, though! Sometimes the best answer is \"oh thank you for asking about [x use case] but we're not interested in that.\"</p>\n<p>I'll give a couple examples. A lot of Conjur's secret management functionality is built around Postgres features. We use pg streaming replication for high availability, we use stored procedures to implement auditing and the permissions model, we use rich JSON data fields in a number of areas. People in the community a number of times have proposed making Conjur compatible with another database, like Cassandra or MongoDB are two that came up. And the answer is basically no. Decoupling Conjur from the db tech it's built on and abstracting over all that would be a significant undertaking and make the codebase really interesting, where we're going for a boring, reliable, auditable codebase for a security-critical application. That's not a valid use case /for Conjur/.</p>\n<p>In elementary OS, the community often contributes dekstop themes for which they would like to see official upstream support. The elementary team takes design seriously and so we tend to attract a lot of designers who want to give it their touch of creativity. The answer is basically no, elementary OS will not support themes. Part of our contract with app designers for elementary is that you are in control of the look and feel of your app, subject to the interface guidelines provided, and the OS will not clobber that. So custom theming is not a valid use case for elementary OS.</p>\n<p>Those conversations are usually not tense. Of course people are welcome to take the code in any direction that they like, but the project doesn't need to be a party to that. Part of the burnout that a lot of open source maintainers feel can come from a combination of saying \"yes\" to a niche use case too often, taking on the accompanying burdens on time &amp; mental capacity, and laboring over every \"no\" and trying to leave nobody unsatisfied, rather than saying \"not interested\" and letting that be enough.</p>",

A lot of that is because <code>cargo</code> has basic conventions for making new commands (if there is an executable file named \"cargo-whatevs\" in your <code>$PATH</code>, then <code>cargo whatevs</code> will call that file with a well-established calling convention). If you do <code>cargo install cargo-tree</code>, then the <code>cargo tree</code> command will print out your project's dependency tree, for an example of a nifty Cargo trick that doesn't even need to have been put there by the core Cargo devs. Plus <a href=\"http://crates.io\" title=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> and the whole package ecosystem, though that's less unique.</p>",

This can lead to a new attack on a problem, or sometimes unblock something you didn't quite realize was blocking you.</li>\n<li>Getting away from the computer: going on walks or biking, and sleeping.

I feel that I should be making more progress on something, I get flustered that the thing I end up working on or researching something isn't what I'd intended or anticipated, and that makes me feel like it would be shameful to share what I'm working on with other people. I want to get past the block before I share, so that I can share happy positive news that I've made progress in the intended direction, instead of sharing that I'm blocked and relate what I'm trying to do to get unblocked.</p>\n<p>One ritual that has helped me get past many blocks, in math as well as programming, is to take a long walk to a coffee shop with just notebooks and pens (no laptop) to work. I write out long-hand about the problems I'm working on, using notation I develop myself, creating maps, diagrams, process flows as necessary. Walking a moderate distance (1.75-2.25 miles seems to be the sweet spot for me) is part of what makes this work, because during the walk I think about things and it gets me ready to write when I arrive and order my coffee. I know which coffee shops are within my sweet spot radius, so when I recognize I'm blocked I pack my small backpack with some notebooks and pens and head off.</p>",
