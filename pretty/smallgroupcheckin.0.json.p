I've been doing this bad thing where I forget/put off writing until right before bed, which leads to me quickly trying to bang out 500 sub par words at 2am before going to sleep. Last night I again did this, but I wrote ~600 kind of ok words about setting up the steno keyboard that Bert and I purchased, which arrived in the mail yesterday. There were some funny issues with drivers and getting USB over serial to work, and this wasn't documented anywhere, so I figured I should put it on the internet.</p>",

And that it might dramatically increase in popularity if it were more accessible. I'll post my blog post draft here when I finish it hopefully later today, I go into a little more detail there about what I mean.</p>",

It turned out I was telling aiohttp (the library doing my http requests) to return the response to me as a string instead of raw bytes, and it was coercing the non-standard utf-8 byte into the replacement character. So I just had to change <code>response.text()</code> to <code>response.read()</code>. In the more generalized case, from what I read, if the replacement character shows up it probably means that you're trying to translate an un-supported byte into your chosen encoding, and you should just work backwards to the place that you did that conversion.</p>",

I think it's quite annoying how often people give complicated security advice that's too difficult to follow for non-technical people and doesn't align with what is probably their threat model. I think technical people tend to forget that, the more complicated the advice you give, the less likely it is that any of it will be followed. Whereas, if you say, \"the MOST IMPORTANT thing you can do is install updates. ALWAYS install updates. If you do nothing else, install them\", you are more likely to have success. And I think you did a good job of picking the best things that fall in this category. This makes me wonder, why is this such a blind spot for a lot of technical people? It seems to me like it happens a lot, and not just for security advice.</p>",

In the case of bencoding, the encoding used by bittorrent, things that are text fields are ascii encoded. But, when I was calling the .text() method on the http response I was getting, my http library was assuming I wanted utf-8, despite the response not being utf-8. The actual non-standard part of the response was the ip address, which was encoded as 6 bytes; 4 being the numbers of the ip address and 2 being the port. I'm actually not positive what the non-standard character was...the range of numbers in ip address is 0-255, which all fall within utf-8. I'll double check to try to figure out what exactly went wrong and report back, I kind of glossed over it once I fixed it.</p>",
