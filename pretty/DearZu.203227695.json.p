Other than that, I have to remind myself that after 30 minutes to an hour of being stuck, I will ask for help.</p>",

I feel that I should be making more progress on something, I get flustered that the thing I end up working on or researching something isn't what I'd intended or anticipated, and that makes me feel like it would be shameful to share what I'm working on with other people. I want to get past the block before I share, so that I can share happy positive news that I've made progress in the intended direction, instead of sharing that I'm blocked and relate what I'm trying to do to get unblocked.</p>\n<p>One ritual that has helped me get past many blocks, in math as well as programming, is to take a long walk to a coffee shop with just notebooks and pens (no laptop) to work. I write out long-hand about the problems I'm working on, using notation I develop myself, creating maps, diagrams, process flows as necessary. Walking a moderate distance (1.75-2.25 miles seems to be the sweet spot for me) is part of what makes this work, because during the walk I think about things and it gets me ready to write when I arrive and order my coffee. I know which coffee shops are within my sweet spot radius, so when I recognize I'm blocked I pack my small backpack with some notebooks and pens and head off.</p>",
