I used to set up these addresses to forward somewhere that I'd check from time to time, but I never received anything but auto-replies. Some of this might be specific to SES, where replies seem to get redirected to your return path (ie, where bounce/complaint notifications go).</p>\n<p>I've seen those articles too but haven't found them too convincing. I suspect that advice is more valuable with (spammier) models that need to juice every last bit of open rate, or those \"I'm the CEO and I'd love to hear from you!\" drip-marketing setups that I find annoying.</p>",
