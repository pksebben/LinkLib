But now, I am curious to have somebody review my financial decisions that I have been taking so far and let me know if there's some course correction to be done. Does anybody here use or have used a financial advisor? If yes, is there any recommendation on how to select one or recommend somebody they used?</p>",

Main thing is beware of conflicts of interest which are common, so my advisor is totally independent (has his own consultancy LLC) and works on strictly hourly fees for consultation. No commissions, percentages, fees, etc. His hourly rate is high at first glance but I end up paying him about 2 hours per year for a checkup and he doesn't charge me for the odd question over email here and there throughout the year.</p>",
