It's the main inspiration behind that invisible circle generative art thing I presented a few weeks ago. I'd argue that my piece is basically fan art of the Process Compendium works.</p>\n<p>Specifically, he documents each work in the Process Compendium as a short paragraph describing at a super high level what the software implementing that work should do (very much like Sol Lewitt's Wall Drawings, for those familiar with Lewitt's work). There's a lot of wiggle room in the text so trying to follow it by the book can still create pretty divergent results, plus you can always depart from it when you feel like it.</p>\n<p>(His website and therefore the documentation of the work is currently down but hopefully it'll be up by the time the session happens.)</p>",
