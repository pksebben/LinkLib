One of the interviewers seemed pretty unhappy when he asked me the standard \u201cdesign twitter\u201d question (which I had no idea was a standard question that a lot of companies ask) and I sort of flailed around for a bit before figuring out something that might make sense. Oh, also! Haha, there's an also. Also, one of the two interviewers kept asking me questions I'd already heard. I said so every time, but he had a skeptical tone of voice like he didn't believe me and made me sketch out answers to each question I'd heard before. After four or five iterations of that he gave up and asked me the design twitter question. So pretty much a total train wreck from both sides.</p>",

It was the first phone screen, a google doc coding interview. I totally froze up and basically failed to speak coherently and even attempt to answer the question. Needless to say I did not hear back and it did not go well :)</p>\n<p>Ironically the next rejection story is related. I went in to OkCupid to interview after HS (one of my post-HS interviews), and the interview was a trainwreck. Why? They actually asked that <strong>same interview question</strong> I froze up on like 5 years ago @ Google, and I still didn't know how to answer it (it was some math-y thing), plus I double-froze because I suddenly had flashbacks to my old google interview and got even more nervous. Definitely not a good interview, and this was for a full-day of on-site interviews @ OkCupid. They kindly escorted me out of the building before I even got to lunch. Fun fact: I forgot my nalgene in the interview room, which I realized immediately upon leaving, but I was too embarrassed by how poorly the interview went to go back in and ask to pick it up.</p>\n<p>Oh, also in like 2012 or so I intervewed @ box. I don't really remember why (i wasn't super actively looking for a job, but i was itching for 'the next thing'---i soon after quit my job to go to HS). We did a typical whiteboard coding question over the phone, and I did terribly again. I was basically totally unprepared for any of these sorts of interviews.</p>",

And they basically told me that (in much nicer terms) and then offered to have me do a coding exercise instead, which would have involved testing a thing that they use in production. I pushed back on the scope of the project since it sounded like it might be unreasonably large. There were a number of iterations where I gave specific example projects that took way took much longer than their estimated timeframe that seemed easier than their project. Each time, they replied with a comment saying they expected it would be fine (with no further explanation). I eventually asked what they expected to get out of the exercise in terms of specific output to try to nail down the meaning of \"fine\" and never heard back. I'm guessing I could have followed up on this, so this is on me as much as anyone.</p>",

            "content": "<p>I've had a shorter career so far so I only really have one rejection story (beyond sent a resume and never heard back type deal). I was particularly enamored with Khan Academy at the time and applied there. This was back when emscripten and <a href=\"http://repl.it\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://repl.it\">repl.it</a> were just getting popular so a few years ago I suppose. I mashed up one of their exercise pages with a python repl (compiled to js from c) and had a neat little page going where kids could do exercises of various sorts.  This got their attention and I was able to get a phone interview. It was during winter break for me (still in college at the time) and I had volunteered to teach some kids introductory programming with Clojure at my old high school for a week full time (some kids loved clojure, some hated it, so it goes, but I really did believe in the idea of kids learning to program). The email from Khan said that they were fine with any programming language, the engineers were smart, etc.  so I decided to use Clojure during the interview with Khan (after spending a month preparing to teach kids some Clojure). The day of the interview comes and I realize last minute I messed up the time zones, so instead of being at 6am locally like I thought it was at noon my time. I should have rescheduled, duh, but I was too nervous about looking not dumb and  the interview was during my lunch break, so I decided to roll with it. I had just spent the full morning teaching kids Clojure when I started the interview in the corner of some office so I was pretty ready to go. Started the interview, first thing interview says is \"I don't know lisp\" but they were willing to try and follow. Got a bad vibe, but kept going, doing the little Fibonacci sequence problem pretty easily but it was pretty clear the interviewer did not follow. I switched languages to javascript  after the first problem, but it just wasn't happening and I got stuck on trying to do a packing problem in JS. Awful interview overall and got the reject email within 24 hours. Bitterly disappointed after that and haven't really trusted or been comfortable in interviews ever since.  </p>",

An older Caucasian male in a state of considerable agitation reported that his \"thunder\" had been stolen by a group of cats and monkeys operating out of 455 Broadway.</p>\n<p>The man told officers these playful and caudate creatures had learned of the acceptance by a computer science conference of a paper of his, and before he had a chance to act on the news, transmitted it publicly. He accused them further of violating his privacy, connecting his online identity with the conference's published version of his abstract, which did not of itself identify him uniquely, there being any number of people floating around with the <a href=\"http://radaris.com/p/David/Branner/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://radaris.com/p/David/Branner/\">same name</a>. He was now getting \"follower\" announcements from people on Twitter, and he felt humiliated that his news had been published without his consent or knowledge.</p>\n<p>Officers offered their condolences on his loss and passed his case to the NYPD Division of Feline-Simian Malfeasance. It appears the victim does not have insurance coverage against theft of thunder. Officers advised him that in the mean time he had four options for dealing with the alleged crime:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to withdraw his submitted abstract from the conference, thereby \"showing\" everybody;</li>\n<li>to cancel his Twitter account, rendering invalid the connection to his on-line identity;</li>\n<li>to change his name at the County Clerk's office, confusing the author-attribution of the abstract;</li>\n<li>to shut up and stop his whining already (however, the man produced what he asserted was a municipal <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/infrastructure/permits.shtml#public_whining\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/infrastructure/permits.shtml#public_whining\">whining permit</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Detectives of the NYPD-DFSM will be investigating.</p>\n<p>[end]</p>",

It turns out my assigned buddy was someone I had interviewed at a previous job, and he was bitter.  I think I had given maybe a lukewarm review (certainly not a bad one), but it turns out my company just completely ignored him, and didn't even respond to his emails, after having told him after the interview that we'd get back to him after a week.  Awkward situation.  (and a reminder that the candidate's view of an interview outcome might not tell the whole story.  I think this happened to several people I interviewed at that company.)</p>",
