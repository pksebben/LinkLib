I'm helping to build a consultancy (I'm the first hire, and we have two contractors right now that we are considering hiring) and I'm giving a lot of thought to who how we build a culture that is productive and awesome to be a part of for  many years.</p>\n<p>We'd like to build a company that is remote-friendly and office-optional from the beginning. We are struggling with how to think about some of the social basics. How do we stay cohesive socially/existentially if we don't see each other for days? and more pressingly, how do we keep up a culture and expectation of high quality and volume of work without micromanaging? </p>\n<p><strong>part of this is the \"how do you know work is getting done without using 'hours spent butt in chair' as a proxy\"</strong> question. I know this is well-trod ground but it's green field for me. </p>\n<p>I'm curious 1) both what has worked and not worked in your experience and 2) any resources that are useful in how to think about these social norms in the context of a tech company (ie not the \"Remote\" book by 37Signals, which uses 'trust your people' as a bit of a cop-out in how to tactically address this issue)</p>",

Initially we had no formal structure whatsoever and it was more based on a \"trust your people\"-principle. While my project manager did that, it wasn't very productive for either of us. After wrestling and testing a bit back and forth we ended up with weekly meetings, preferably in person, but on Skype if one couldn't make it in person. More important than the meeting however was the continuous follow-up on concrete targets. 1) What have we (both of us) done to get closer to  where we want to go? 2) Has what we've learned this week changed the target somehow? 3) What tasks do we focus on till next week? </p>\n<p>Later we also added weekly demos of the development that had been done during the week. These were held on Friday afternoons (the weekly meetings on Mondays). That was usually a great way to end the week. Again, if we couldnt be there in person we'd demo over Skype/Screenshare. I should add that the Friday demos were more \"fun\" and more relaxed than the Monday meetings. Small things make a difference there, like taking notes and updating Trello immediately made it more formal. </p>\n<p>A consultancy company in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, that I think gets a few things right (though many others not) is Jayway. One key cultural feature is the focus on sharing knowledge. They do get togethers only to give talks to each others. They have weekend retreats. A decent blog. Etc. The goal (from what I've heard from a friend working there) is to create a sense of belonging even though they might be out working with different customers all over the country. </p>",

We had a pretty good remote relationship at Openplans. The whole time HAD to be on IRC. Basically if you were on IRC you were working. The frontend dev I worked with hooked me up with Skitch, where I grabbed screenshots and wrote comments on it. We Skyped when we got stuck. He was just there all the time. He came to NYC once a quarter.</p>",

            "content": "<p>I just finished writing a long email to a project-manager friend whose workplace is trying out remote work for 1 week to see how it goes. She asked me about Mozilla's policies on remote work and I thought I'd share my giant response here. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>I feel like Mozilla doesn't have many company-wide policies about remote work. Employees are expected to have a \"primary location\" - company office, your home, a co-working space - that includes a quiet space for meetings. You can expense home-office equipment. The company has invested in infrastructure to make it really easy to a have a meeting (or look at past meetings or text chats) no matter what your location or time zone. Everyone is provided with a laptop, headset and webcam even if they work in a company office. All office meeting rooms are equipped with video conferencing. There's a common saying: \"We are all remote,\" even if you work in a Mozilla office.</p>\n<p>Company-wide tools: Google for calendar/email, Vidyo for meetings, IRC for chat, and internal wikis for documentation, meeting minutes, etc. We also use an issue tracker called Bugzilla. Almost nothing is handled by phone.</p>\n<p>The 'culture' of remote work really varies by team, but I guess there's a general expectation of 8 hours of work per day (7 hours of work + 1 hour of break for meals) and that you have daily contact with your closest colleagues about what you're working on and what your approximate schedule is. I've never encountered any explicit expectations about 'response time', but people are pretty responsive and they clearly indicate when they are away for longer periods.</p>\n<p>On my team, 20/27 people work from home; we are all programmers (so we work on similar stuff; the managers are programmers, too); all the managers on our team are remote; the team spans many time zones including Europe and Australia -- so remote work is a core part of how we work. Here are some patterns I've observed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There's a lot of regular, asynchronous written communication so that everyone is on the same page. Some examples below.</li>\n<li>Accountability is mostly measured in terms of progress on your deliverables for the quarter. I have listed examples of how we report that progress below.</li>\n<li>Everyone meets 1:1 with their managers for 1 hour every week. This is more for long-term planning, feelings, career advice, challenges -- rather than for a status update.</li>\n<li>Smaller sub-teams might have daily 10-minute status meetings or short weekly meetings. It's important to keep the status meetings short and schedule separate meetings for deeper discussion.</li>\n<li>Some people meet 1:1 for a few minutes here and there just for fun; this helps build a friendly work atmosphere, good relationships.</li>\n<li>Internal status report: The entire team (27 people) meets for a general update for 20-60 minutes ever two weeks. Everyone writes down the status of their deliverables in a shared google doc and if your deliverable is at risk, you are expected to point that out during meeting discussion to make sure other people can help you get unblocked, etc. Some people never go to this meeting because it's at a bad time for their time zone and that's ok. The meeting notes are in a Google doc and on a wiki so they can catch up later.</li>\n<li>External status report: Everyone writes down \"significant progress\" every two weeks on a public shared document (<a href=\"https://ateam.etherpad.mozilla.org/weekly-updates\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ateam.etherpad.mozilla.org/weekly-updates\">https://ateam.etherpad.mozilla.org/weekly-updates</a>) and our leading manager summarizes that progress in an email announcement to all Firefox engineers. (Example here: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.tools/SY642-6A3PY\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.tools/SY642-6A3PY\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.tools/SY642-6A3PY</a>)</li>\n<li>Work hours are flexible, but people are encouraged to have a regular routine (for their own sanity). The work hours don't have to be \"traditional\": e.g. 12-8 local time is fine; or 7-10AM plus 6-11PM, whatever. Obviously people try to maintain some overlap so they can meet with their coworkers and managers. Managers discourage their reports from working too long in one day. A clear division between work and life is encouraged, so it's quite rare for people to work late/extra hours in their time zone. We're not expected to check our emails outside of our personal work hours.</li>\n<li>It's totally OK to step away from work for a few hours to go to an appointment or run errands or whatever, and then make up the lost time later in the day or week. If the interruption isn't part of your regular work routine, you let your manager and closest colleagues know and that's that. If the interruption can't be compensated by working extra later, you take time off instead.</li>\n<li>Most day-to-day communication happens in a team chat room (or private 1:1 chat rooms). The public chat history is searchable so it's easy to catch up or remember a past conversation, but no one is expected to keep track of all that has been said. Important discussions are moved to email. Example of chat log: <a href=\"http://logs.glob.uno/?a=search&amp;c=mozilla%23ateam&amp;q=taskcluster&amp;ss=1+Jun+2015&amp;se=2+Jun+2015\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://logs.glob.uno/?a=search&amp;c=mozilla%23ateam&amp;q=taskcluster&amp;ss=1+Jun+2015&amp;se=2+Jun+2015\">http://logs.glob.uno/?a=search&amp;c=mozilla%23ateam&amp;q=taskcluster&amp;ss=1+Jun+2015&amp;se=2+Jun+2015</a> People use these chat rooms for some casual conversation also.</li>\n<li>People usually indicate their status in the chat system (like \"maja_zf\" means I'm at my computer, \"maja_zf|afk\" means I'm \"away from keyboard\" and \"maja_zf|mtg\" means I'm in a meeting.</li>\n<li>Some sub-teams use services like Trello or PivotalTracker to coordinate their tasks and track status in a more fine-grained way, but most project-related discussion (including planning, dependencies) happens in our company-wide issue tracker (example: <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1197234\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1197234\">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1197234</a>)</li>\n<li>Meeting notes are often published in our company wiki or in shared Google docs, etc.</li>\n<li>Once every 3-6 months, everyone on a team or sub-team meets in person in an office for a few days to work side-by-side. This is mostly for long-term planning and social bonding and is a very helpful 'reset' for the isolation of full-time remote work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think this works out pretty well over all and I'm really happy working from home right now. I think I have a good routine set up. Sometimes I feel isolated, but informal meeting help. The hardest part for me is asking questions and getting help: I can't just quickly talk to the person whose desk is next to mine and show them my issue. I have to formulate a specific question, decide whether that questions should go into chat or email (sometimes it's not clear) and decide who the question should be directed to, etc. But I've always been awkward about asking work-related questions and I'm getting better at it. I think part of the barrier is the written communication feels more formal to me.</p>\n<p>Another hard thing is keeping track of what everyone's doing in a way that prevents you from reinventing the wheel. You really have to be proactive about sharing your issues and thinking out loud, in case someone has solved a similar problem the year before or whatever.</p>",

I'm lucky to have a lot of flexibility with where I work: my team is distributed across ~5 different locations, with no more than 3 people in each location; I have an office that I can choose to use if I wish, though I don't have any direct coworkers there; everything is already set up to be remote-friendly.</p>\n<p>tldr; I've realized that I'm going to be happier + healthier if I work remote more often instead of going into the office, which I used to do 3-4 days per week. I'm nervous about making the switch, both for practical and social reasons.
