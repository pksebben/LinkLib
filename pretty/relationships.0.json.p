On the other hand, if that thing is \"I had a conversation with $person where we talked about $thing\" (and $thing is somewhat private), that seems not good (since $thing should be, by default, between you and $person).</p>\n<p>How do people balance this? I guess I could explicitly reach out to people and check before sharing things, but that seems pretty heavyweight and possibly awkward. I've been increasingly leaning towards not sharing things, since that feels right to me, but I'm curious what other folks think :)</p>",

            "content": "<p>I've been thinking about this kind of thing for a while, and actually wrote a long thing about <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18CoWFxWrgqpU_iKqgFof7NRw7UPwomDOkGp07OE70OY/edit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18CoWFxWrgqpU_iKqgFof7NRw7UPwomDOkGp07OE70OY/edit\">talking about people when they're not around</a> a month or so ago</p>\n<p>agreed with Glenn that it's really complicated and there are so many factors I could consider - why am I sharing? how private is the person I'm talking about? does my partner know them? (how well do they know them?) how does my sharing this thing about someone affect my partner's perception of them? how private is the content I'm sharing?</p>\n<p>two sections of what I wrote feel particularly relevant to this topic/specific question around partners - and are also two sections of the writing where I am least confident about how to think about this :p</p>\n<h3>What about people you \u201cshare everything with\u201d?</h3>\n<p>There are definitely people who share lots of things with their partners or best friends. I can see how in relationships like these, people talk a lot about what\u2019s going on in their life, and part of that talking is about other people.</p>\n<p>But it seems almost normalized that if I share something fairly personal with someone, they will likely tell their partner or best friend about it. I\u2019ve shared personal stories with partners as well! But is this reasonable? Is this something most people know is happening and are okay with?</p>\n<h3>Should I always ask people if I can share something about them?</h3>\n<p>Different folks have different boundaries and different preferences for how things about them are shared. Some people have suggested that I just ask people for consent when I want to share something about them. And some friends have told me they\u2019d prefer to know everything that\u2019s been told to other people about them. Of course this is impractical - I share various things about people all the time (and believe it is beneficial that I do) and so many of them are small and I would never put in the energy to ask about all of them. I try to ask about bigger things, but \u201cbig\u201d is different for different people, and it can be hard to understand the subtleties of people\u2019s boundaries.</p>\n<p>I also think that people generally accept that people will share personal information about each other, but don\u2019t like to know about what is shared about them (and it can often feel embarrassing to know!). A friend talked to me about how they\u2019re generally okay with people sharing things about them without them knowing about it, but if someone asked directly \u201ccan I tell my friend about this weird thing you did?\u201d they would probably feel weird about it and say no.</p>\n<p>We all talk about people when they're not around, and there are real benefits to it, but a lot of people would be uncomfortable to know what kinds of things people knew about them. And so, we all continue in this weird setup where we talk about other people when they\u2019re not around, don\u2019t know if we\u2019re breaking boundaries, and don't know (and often don't want to know) what other people know about us. I\u2019m still figuring out how I feel about this.</p>",

It helped me bounce ideas off of someone when I was considering giving advice, it helped me vent when I needed that, and it made us feel very close. After a time I realized that I was sharing things that others had expected me to keep quiet. Since that's very disrespectful, I started keeping more things to myself, and I rarely feel like I have lost anything.</p>\n<p>I recall talking to one of my partners at the time about how my other partner was very stressed due to emotionally supporting someone in a difficult situation. I wanted to process some of my emotions about that situation, but I didn't want to share the details. My partner expected a lot more detail than I was willing to give, and it made me very angry. I think there is a large difference between, \"X is stressed because they're trying to help their friend out of a difficult situation\" and, \"X is stressed because Y [details about this stranger's living situation] [details about this stranger's health] [details about this stranger's work situation].\" I'm sure there are situations where sharing the former with a partner would not be acceptable, but there aren't many. To compare, sharing the latter seems like voyeurism.</p>\n<p>Currently, I don't tell any of my partners or friends everything, partially because a lot of those details are boring (\"And then I spent 2 hours on a layout bug\"), and partially because I don't feel like I owe anyone that. Sharing slightly less has not made any of my relationships less fulfilling.</p>",

Like so many norms in software vs the rest of the world, I think at most software shops, coming out as poly would be totally fine with the company culture. Google has an unofficial poly mailing list, even. (Google has a lot of things, though.) So mostly it's about whether you expect the people you work directly with to be cool about it, I guess. So probably worth getting to know them first?</p>",

Or only talk about it if it comes up directly (\"Oh hey are you going to Pride?\" \"Yep.\").</p>\n<p>In my  experience--biased heavily in favor of startups where everything is too on fire to have time to waste doing stupid office drama, so take it for what it is--nobody cares about \"slutty\" behavior unless it involves other coworkers, their partners/spouses, clients, or investors. Everybody should be too busy creating shareholder value (lol) to be wasting time on that stuff.</p>\n<p>At a previous gig we had one openly pagan person, one openlypoly person with multiple partners and families, several other orientations and arrangements, at least one labor agitator, one green anarchist, and so on--but I think there's a difference between being openly &lt;x&gt; and bringing it up out of context. Our personal lives were of far less interest during conversation than blown milestones, internal project maneuvering, and so forth.</p>\n<p>And yeah, agree with Wesley--just use \"partner\" and let them be puzzled if they think too hard on it.</p>\n<p>EDIT: </p>\n<p>There is a secondary question to consider here, which is what being out means <em>to you</em>. Everyone kinda has to find their own way in that. For some folks, that means acknowledging their status and moving on with life. For other folks, that means actively including their friends and partners to the degree to which they're comfortable. For still others, that may mean aggressively and flamboyantly flaunting or proselytizing their status.</p>\n<p><strong>There's no wrong way to be out</strong>, but knowing yourself enough to know what your style is probably would help greatly in approaching this sort of question and having confidence in your direction.</p>",

There are two rumors about breaking up that I feel might be helpful to address here. One is that breakups should be clean. The other is that you should only break up when you're not in love. </p>\n<p>The truth is, breakups are usually messy, the way people are messy, the way life is often messy. It's okay for a breakup to feel like a disaster. It doesn't feel okay, but I assure you it is okay.</p>\n<p>It's also true that you can break up with someone you still love. Because those two things are not distinct territories: love and not loving anymore. I think it's true that the older you get, and I am very old, the more you see that being in love and breaking up have a lot in common. Which makes me think that a lot of the questions you have about breaking up might be better thought of as questions about the nature of the love you have with this girl. </p>\n<p>What is it like to love this person who [....]? What does your love with this person offer you? Does it make you happy? Does it give you what you need to be a better person? [...] your love should be a thing that brings something to you. It's true that giving can be a part of love. But, contrary to popular belief, love should never take from you</p>\n<p>Have faith in yourself to know what's right for you.

            "content": "<p>Dear Doctor Zu, I could use your advice on a situation I feel stuck in.</p>\n<p>I'm in a close relationship with K. Our approach to relationships is similar, and could probably be described as solo polyamory/relationship anarchy - a non-hierarchical approach that lets relationships develop naturally and without a predefined image of what they are \"supposed to\" look like.</p>\n<p>Now, K lives in a 4-person household, together with C. I'm interested in getting to know C better, but K is scared of that thought. The two of them had a situation in the past where they were interested in the same person, had a rivalry-like thing, and in the end, both lost touch with that person and blamed each other. Sometimes they seem to get along quite well, and other times, not at all.</p>\n<p>K said that she's nervous about C and me getting closer/falling in love. Also, she made it very clear that she doesn't want C to know about that. It has happened several times that C and me were at an event together, or just spent time together, and K felt horrible after that - she says that she's afraid she'll have to get less involved with me to protect herself, if C and me would be closer. I don't want K to feel horrible, and I want some stability in my relationships. Because of that, so far, I've kept my distance to C.</p>\n<p>But still, this feels very unresolved and unstable. I feel like I have no good options: if I get closer to C, that could lead to a lot of drama. At the same time, because of K's wishes, I don't feel like I can tell C <em>why</em> I'm keeping my distance, which seems unfair to her, and weird for me. I'd <em>like</em> to get to know C better, and I think she does, as well.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what importance I should place on making sure that potential partners get along well, how to balance respecting K's privacy but not lying through omission to C, or how I could support K in processing her jealousy. When I bring this up with her, she gets scared and sad (and says that she usually avoids thinking about this), so that hasn't been really fruitful so far. And I can sympathize with those fears so much! But for me, in the long term, it has always been better to expose myself to the things I'm afraid of.</p>",

One non-hierarchical, and two \"hierarchical\". Every relationship I have been in has had some level of conflict between myself and the person I was directly dating, but the V in which my metamour and I had tension between us was the above-and-beyond the most stressful and painful scenario. My friend referred to it as a \"double-bind\" for the reason you are noticing. There is <em>no answer</em> that is going to result in minimal pain. Every party is going to be hurt on some level, no matter which decision you make. K has a lot of trauma from the past double-bind she has been part of for that reason. She is setting a boundary against being in another. As someone who also has trauma from my past double-bind, I deeply, deeply empathise with this. </p>\n<p>If I were in this situation, I think this is a conversation that I would encourage to happen between K and C, and that I would actually suggest having a polyamory-friendly couples therapist facilitating that conversation. But otherwise, you are stuck between a rock and a hard place. I think it is almost impossible for relationships to not have some form of affect on each other, and for commitments to not slowly occur over time, which is why I do not really identify as a relationship anarchist anymore.</p>\n<p>How you move forward in terms of deciding whether to honour K's boundaries and artificially restrict a nascent intimacy...is in your court. No one can really advise you on what to do there. Nobody else really knows about the nature of your commitment to K or the extent towards your feelings for C, or how much you relatively weigh the ethics of honouring existing relationship commitments vs allowing a third party to dictate the intimacy of a relationship they are not a part of. But I think for K's and C's sake, I hope they do approach this together, considering that they continue to be part of the same polyamorous community.</p>",

You can date either one, but not both, esp at the same time.

It seems counterintuitive to new poly folk; aren't we poly so we can get away from attachment drama?

            "content": "<p>I actually made a note last night to do some journalling about this, so maybe I'll start by writing out some things here haha.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I've been thinking about attachment styles more recently, partially because multiple friends of mine have read about it and been thinking about it, and also because these days I've been especially craving romantic attention and noticing that most of the people I have romantic feelings for are dismissive-avoidant-esque, and this is inconvenient :p Though I think it's pretty interesting that I've ended up in this situation.</p>\n<p>One thing that's worth mentioning right off the bat is that people definitely will fall into different categories of attachment in different relationships, or even different moments of the same relationship. I notice myself in more long-term situations where I will tend towards anxious-attached, and more short-term situations where I'm more dismissive (and then I'm so dismissive that I essentially kill the friendship/relationship ...and then I'm no longer actively in the dismissive role ^^')  I'm pretty sure this is why most of my surviving relationships have me in more of the anxious role? I guess I'm more comfortable in that role and more familiar with how to manage  those feelings? (More journalling to be done there, lol) </p>\n<p>And my friend was also telling me that even if you're usually securely attached, it can be easy to end up anxious around a very dismissive person or to end up dismissive around a very anxious person. So yeah, definitely seems more useful as ways to describe behaviour than ways to label people.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>why is it useful?</p>\n<p>Attachment style theory can be super useful for the same reason as a lot of other personality tests or labels or whatever - it's a way to better understand parts of yourself, through conversations about shared experience, and through learning about various research and therapy and advice around these common patterns.</p>\n<p>It seems pretty common that people end up in relationships where they're pretty deep into playing out the anxious/dismissive dynamic and get stuck, and find it hard to communicate their needs and especially hard to understand why the other person is acting so differently than them (and why they're acting that way). Attachment theory and the conversation around it gives you language you can use to communicate about it.</p>\n<p>Like, I love <a href=\"/user_uploads/13/uFRmQO9PTtgeL1p2oK9lUj-W/image.png\" title=\"image.png\">posts like this one</a> ( <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-qlFKBh8b1/\" title=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-qlFKBh8b1/\">insta link</a>) that help me understand the ways someone might be feeling if they're acting dismissively. And <a href=\"/user_uploads/13/mq5IX3UrIJRZU2ff9g4tWs8Y/image.png\" title=\"image.png\">this post</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-lFX3_BJDJ/\" title=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-lFX3_BJDJ/\">source</a>) gives me ideas for ways to communicate my needs when I'm feeling anxious. (It also helps me feel more validated for desiring these things! Like, wow, it's reasonable to just ask for that?) When people are feeling uncomfortable, it's often harder to communicate well, and attachment theory provides language that has been useful to a lot of people.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/13/uFRmQO9PTtgeL1p2oK9lUj-W/image.png\" title=\"posts like this one\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/13/uFRmQO9PTtgeL1p2oK9lUj-W/image.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/13/mq5IX3UrIJRZU2ff9g4tWs8Y/image.png\" title=\"this post\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/13/mq5IX3UrIJRZU2ff9g4tWs8Y/image.png\"></a></div><p>For some people this is eye opening because they just didn't realize that they do this at all, that they have these needs, that their behaviour is interpreted in whatever way. In reading about attachment theory and discovering (or becoming more clearly aware of) a bunch of things about yourself or people close to you, a bunch of opportunities open up to make changes to help your relationships feel more healthy.</p>\n<p>For me it was really nice to just have words to describe it, both to explain to others how I feel, and also to be able to clearly reach the point of thinking \"ah yes, we're just both stressed about this relationship in our own ways, and that happens to easily feedback loop on itself making things more intensely uncomfortable, and now that I know that I can use commonly discussed strategies and language to help this relationship feel more stable\". I could have reached this point without attachment style theory (and in some ways, I did), but it feels way easier to think about this stuff within the context of lots of existing research and terminology.</p>",

As in, intimacy is found in the spaces where people switch their typical roles (the \"anxious\" goes to do something else with their life and stops pursuing, the \"avoidant\" pursues the \"anxious\"). Relationships that have \"longevity\" will have a dance that more or less revolves around that mean.</p>",

Even though the subway is being cleaned more than ever, none of us likes the idea of me getting on 2 trains 4 times a week. My partner has a car, but tolls and parking add up, and they would be sleeping on a pull out couch if they visited. </p>\n<p>It hurts to say that we might not be able to see each other every week for the foreseeable future, but it seems that organizing longer trips less frequently makes more sense.</p>",
