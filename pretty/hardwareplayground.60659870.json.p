The led matrix was identified as <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/products/420\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.adafruit.com/products/420\">this</a> from adafruit. Adafruit has a raspberry pi \"hat\" for interfacing with the raspberry pi to use the matrix as a display. I've looked around for this interface and couldn't find it in Turing. Anybody have any idea if it's still around? I'm also super curious about what sort of project this matrix was previously used for.</p>",
