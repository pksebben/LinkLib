This story somewhat reminds me of the time a personal server took down my former employer's entire rack (with a somewhat important web host in it) when I brought up a slightly misconfigured bridge config - setting itself up to receive all traffic on its switch and looping every packet it received through to itself on a second network interface... Amplification is a terrible thing. (But not half as bad as Linux network configuration)</p>",

So I shredded potatoes into water, washed the starch out 3x, squeezed the water out, laid it out on paper, pressed it dry, and stored it covered in the fridge overnight. Then this morning I got a generous amount of really hot oil, fried up my hash browns til golden, flipped, fried more, and......</p>\n<p>They're fucken raw through and through. I swear to god I cannot make hash browns, it is be-fucking-yond me, I have never succeeded. <span aria-label=\"weary\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f629\" role=\"img\" title=\"weary\">:weary:</span> </p>\n<p>After I couldn't eat it I put it in the microwave for 5 minutes, and it's still raw. I'm just disgusted.</p>\n<p>Latkes I do just fine, and I guess I should just stick to that, but I was seduced by the recent success I've had with freeze dried hashbrown potatoes to think maybe I'd finally crack the code with fresh potatoes if I just gave it one more shot.</p>",
