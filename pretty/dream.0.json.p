I felt like my body was separate from my body, like I was imagining myself moving my arm but knew I wasn't actually moving my arm. It was this weird \"dreaming? but not quite dreaming?\" state. </p>\n<p>I remember wandering around, knowing I was sort of dreaming, but not being able to see anything (sort of like how when I close my eyes while awake, I can't just see clear vivid imagery like I see while awake or while usuall dreaming). I think I had some conversations, that I heard in a more vivid (awake esque) way. Eventually I saw some more vivid things as well.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure vivid is even the right word. I think it's interesting the distinction between imaging seeing/hearing/feeling things, and the more lifelike quality of the senses while in dreams. I especially have trouble keeping the lifelike quality when I find myself lucid dreaming (sometimes just realizing I'm dreaming in the middle of a dream dulls the realness of the things I'm sensing)</p>\n<p>I wish I knew how to explain this better :p</p>",

It turns out everyone is actively hallucinating all the time, and if you tune in to the minute differences in your vision in complete darkness, you can have controlled hallucinations that interact with your imagination in a conscious state. Some people are more naturally tuned in to this. I am at the stage where I can often imagine complex three dimensional figures that change shape fluidly, and I can sometimes imagine the textures as well. Recently I've been getting glimpses of color. If my progress continues at its current rate, I may be able to have fully colored imagination in a few months.</p>",

I talk to her for a bit and it's comforting. When she leaves in grateful she's still alive despite having died almost 4 years ago. Then (as has happened in dreams before) I realize this doesn't make much sense and it was a dream and she is indeed dead.</p>\n<p>Soon after she is there again but I know she's dead, and her face is distorted and I'm a bit scared. She suggests I close my eyes, and she spoons me while we talk and it's better. I'm aware to some extent that it's a dream, but also I don't feel like I'm controlling or expecting what she'll say next. It's like hanging out with her again. (I wish I remember anything we talked about)</p>\n<p>I think we had a couple more conversations in dreams shortly after that one, too, and I was able to have my eyes open to look at her then.</p>",

I found myself then on a dimly lit long corridor, to my left and right there was 2 balconies where light was coming from, the outside of one was brighter and more detailed so I went to look there, the balcony was looking upon a parc and a street. From the color of the sky and the lit street lamps the time seems to be right after sunset, it was beautiful so I decide to jump, and then thought I could also fly for a little bit. I then saw a person walking, I flew down, and  decided to go look at their face to see if it was a face I know or if it was a new face generated by my brain. It turns out to be the latter, and I remember being amazed by the amount of details I could see. But the more I look closer their face starts shifting and deforming, I felt scared and it started getting darker. I managed to control myself to not wake up and decided to ask the person if they knew they were in my dream. They didn't wanna respond and went away and I didn't push further.</p>\n<p>I went then through a cycle of dreams fading out and another one fading in, and me trying to stay lucid and not wake up, I could at some points feel my sleeping body while a dream was fading. I also tried to experiment meditating in one of the dreams but it only did the effect of making me realize that the breath I'm noticing is the same one my sleeping body is doing which made me wake up. I don't remember most of what happened afterwards but this was one of the longest consecutive cycles of lucid dreams I've had in a while.</p>",

I do not see a difference between my brain's ability to predict and model a person's actions and thoughts and their brain's ability to do so. The only difference is accuracy; the better you know someone, the better able you are to model their brain. In the dream world, the model is a hazy approximation of their mind, and that is the same as a radio signal with some amount of noise.</p>\n<p>I have been orienting my lucid dreaming practice towards contacting my dead brother, who was a terribly violent person. Last night I had another dream about him. In it, I attempted to bond with him by sharing an activity, and later was reminded that he is more similar to me than I like to admit to myself when witnessing him doing something when he thought no one was watching. Whenever I encounter my brother in these dreams, he is often not aware that he is in a dream, and I shout at him to make him aware. He often seems confused when he starts to realize what is happening. This time I became angry, because I felt he was ungrateful for the work I had done to resurrect him. Still, I feel progress is being made.</p>",

We were reading a play and I kept missing the turn where my character was supposed to speak because I didn't know what page the play was, sometimes I would just say random words as the line or mumble words.

I find my dead brother is in there. I have been attempting astral projection to speak with him for some months now. He is playing a video game with someone in the room. He looks like he did before he died, not as the child I usually picture in my mind, or as the strange forms he has taken in earlier dream attempts. I speak to him, to ask him why he died. Why was he pretending to be dead if he is alive now? This is something has happened to me in other dreams where I contact my dead friends and family, but when I am not fully lucid. I often conclude in the dream state that they were hiding, or pretending to be dead for other reasons, as I once did for several years. It would make me happier if that were the case. I never saw his corpse. In the dream he did not understand. They never do. How do you convince someone that they're dead?</p>",

There's some sort of medieval situation going on with our buildings and outfits. They say we're going to go to war with the king nearby. I feel nervous about this - is it dangerous? Will people get hurt?</p>\n<p>I call my dad, just in case I'm about to die, just to update him on the situation. I tell him how I'm not even really sure what's about to happen - like, it seems like the medieval setup isn't actually real, so is this battle going to be real?</p>\n<p>I talk to a counsellor. I say something like \"I know you're not actually bald and it's just a fancy hat you're wearing. Is this war the same kind of thing?\" and he's like \"oh no, it's super real. we really don't like that king\"</p>\n<p>Children are travelling in neat single file lines with their counsellors down a path towards another staff member handing out guns. This is really concerning. I think maybe my camp group has already left? I call my mom to let her know I might die soon.</p>\n<p>[for some context, my mom died a few years ago. i don't usually remember this in dreams, but it's weird to think about those parts of dreams after the fact]</p>\n<p>As I'm calling her, I see that the camp isn't like, doing some close range fighting stuff. They're lined up on a hill in a big crowd, shooting these fancy guns and cannons or something to a hill on the other side of the river. (I suppose the kind lives there.) This is relieving until these huge floating robots come and start attacking the group. Kids are running out of the way, but some are definitely dying. I'm freaking out on the phone with my mom, one robot thing comes really close to me and is like, shooting fire at me.</p>\n<p>After this, I don't remember as much, but I think there was a scene later where I was talking to a teenager who was tasked with leading a troop, who's stressed about how many dead and injured folks there are in the buildings. Obviously I'm pretty upset. Like, how important was it to attack this king person that we needed to sacrifice all these children's lives? What the fuck?? I think I wake up around that point</p>\n</div></div>",
