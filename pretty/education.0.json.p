However, the relations between anxiety and performance on complex cognitive tasks have been repeatedly demonstrated to follow a curvilinear fashion. In the current studies, we aimed to address the lack of attention given to the possibility of such complex interplay between emotion and cognition in the math-learning literature by exploring the relations among math anxiety, math motivation, and math cognition. In two samples\u2014young adolescent twins and adult college students\u2014results showed inverted-U relations between math anxiety and math performance in participants with high intrinsic math motivation and modest negative associations between math anxiety and math performance in participants with low intrinsic math motivation. However, this pattern was not observed in tasks assessing participants\u2019 nonsymbolic and symbolic number-estimation ability.\u00a0... </p>\n</blockquote>",

The significance of empathy and a warm attitude in classroom remains an understudied phenomenon in educational sciences. However, research has shown that the interaction between the teacher and the pupil is more important for learning outcomes than structural factors such as educational materials and class sizes. Furthermore, earlier studies have found the teacher-pupil interaction to be a significant factor during the early school years, but there are indications of this interaction playing an important role also later, when the academic challenges become greater and the protective teacher-pupil interaction can be less intensive. ...</p>\n</blockquote>",

A meta-analysis on 19 independent samples (total N = 1695) highlighted that programming aptitude was associated with three personality traits, conscientiousness, openness, and introversion. Moreover, the three traits explained incremental variance components beyond general mental abilities.

The overarching purpose is two-fold: (1) to perform a critical examination of what makes educational software effective for learning (particularly when employed in actual classrooms); (2) to reflect how cognitive science can contribute to meet this goal, by applying and discussing several methodological approaches in five research papers. These include observational approaches (Paper I), quasi-experimental design (Paper II) with conceptual replications (Paper III), post hoc data analysis (Paper IV) and theoretical review (Paper V). A particular example is the concept of teachable agents, or \u201cdigital tutees\u201d: digital characters guided by artificial intelligence techniques which let the human student act as a \u201cteacher\u201d in the digital environment. A focus point in Paper I\u2013IV is how teachable agents may improve students\u2019 learning through social influence. Paper V takes a broader and more theoretical approach by reviewing the current state of educational software presently available to teachers, particularly (but not limited to) so-called \u201ceducational apps\u201d. ...</p>\n<p>... Educational software opens new opportunities for presenting material in several simultaneous modalities, providing individually adaptive feedback, and allowing students to take on different social roles \u2013 all with demonstrated cognitive effects.

Such effects can be explained by the Central Monitoring Theory (CMT) via a process that matches a forward model reflecting expected sensory effects of practiced forms and sensory information during speech. But CMT oversees factors of shared attention as achieved by speaker\u2013listener gaze, and implies that sensory feedback may not affect the learning of unpracticed forms (non-words). These aspects of CMT were examined in two experiments of self-monitoring focusing on oro-sensory feedback. In Experiment 1 we show that varying feedback creates differential effects on memory for spoken words and that speaker\u2013listener gaze alters these effects. Using non-words, Experiment 2 shows the absence of differential feedback effects. The results confirm CMT but suggest the need to refine the theory in terms of processes that mediate attention.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This investigation explored whether positivity bias in the degree to which people overestimate their past performance contributes to this gender gap. To find out, two studies were conducted with undergraduate college students in the Southern United States. In Study 1, participants (n\u2009=\u2009122) completed a math test and estimated the percent they had solved. They then were given feedback and completed a second math test and estimation. Men overestimated their performance more than women, judging they had done better on the test than they actually had. This gender difference was not present after feedback. Further, women, but not men, who reported a more positive previous experience with math were more likely to overestimate their performance. In Study 2, participants (n\u2009=\u2009184) completed a math test and estimated the percent they had solved. They also reported their interest in pursuing math courses and careers. Again, men overestimated their performance more than women. This greater overestimation of performance in men accounted for their greater intent to pursue math fields compared to women. The findings suggest that gender gaps in STEM fields are not necessarily the result of women _underestimating_ their abilities, but rather may be due to men _overestimating_ their abilities.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This paper presents a pair of studies that compare two strategies: self-assessments and relational measures of group consensus. In Study 1, unacquainted participants provided round-robin judgments following a set of collaborative tasks. A social relations analysis revealed no consensus for either construct, making the relational measure untenable. However, a round-robin design following months of cooperative course work (Study 2) produced consensus for both constructs. Self-reported IH in both studies was positively associated with self-enhancement, despite the construct\u2019s definitional association with accurate self-appraisals, whereas relational IH was not.

Claims about influence are typically inferred from data collected at a single time point, and may misrepresent the nature of influence. To investigate the iterative influence of WM and Worry and/or vice versa, 133 fourteen-year-olds completed WM and Worry measures several times over the course of a single day as they prepared for a math test. We used a bivariate latent difference score model to analyse possible changes in WM\u2013Worry relationships. The best fitting model indicated high Worry predicts decreases in WM, and low or decreased WM predicts increases in Worry; high WM with low Worry predicts accurate problem solving; low WM with high Worry predicts inaccurate problem solving. Findings show relationships between WM and Worry varies considerably over a single day, and initial disadvantages become worse over time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[end]</p>",

Let me describe what I had in mind for this stream.<br>\n<br>\nI ran foreign language classrooms for a couple of decades (rounded down). I abandoned academia in 2008 and cut my last salaried ties with it last year, after which I got my first programming job. A year on, I decided to try to move into the teaching of programming and computer science, and I've just found work in a for-profit school. It seems possible that this may end up being my actual second career, something I've been moving toward now for the proverbial seven years of indentureship. If so, I intend to try to attack this target properly. <br>\n<br>\nI am interested in what it takes for people to learn to code and to conduct the other activities needed to reason in this field; I'm interested as both a learner myself and someone who leads and shepherds others as they learn. So I've begun keeping records of the many abstracts of academic research I read, when the topics pertain to issues touched on in learning to code. I have in mind to post them here and make them easier for other interested people to see and discuss. I hope other people will feel comfortable posting and discussing here, too.<br>\n<br>\nI'd like to keep the topics to pedagogical and social issues (broadly construed) that affect the learning of coding and related technical skills.<br>\n<br>\nNote that Sec. 107 of U.S. copyright law protects as \"fair use\" the re-posting of published abstracts and snippets of text for purpose of research.</p>",

An important reason for this disparity is that girls are less likely than boys to enroll in necessary \u201cpipeline courses,\u201d such as introductory computer science. Two experiments investigated whether high-school girls\u2019 lower interest than boys in enrolling in computer science courses is influenced by stereotypes of the field. We further tested whether these stereotypes can be communicated by the physical classroom environment, and whether changing this environment alters girls\u2019 interest. In 2 experiments (N = 269), a computer science classroom that did not project current computer science stereotypes caused girls, but not boys, to express more interest in taking computer science than a classroom that made these stereotypes salient. The gender difference was mediated by girls\u2019 lower sense of belonging in the course, even beyond the effects of negative stereotype concerns, expectations of success, and utility value. Girls\u2019 lower sense of belonging could be traced to lower feelings of fit with computer science stereotypes. Individual differences in fit with stereotypes predicted girls\u2019 belonging and interest in a stereotypical, but not a nonstereotypical, classroom. Adolescence is a critical time for career aspirations. Girls may avoid computer science courses because current prevailing stereotypes of the field signal to them that they do not belong. However, providing them with an educational environment that does not fit current computer science stereotypes increases their interest in computer science courses and could provide grounds for interventions to help reduce gender disparities in computer science enrollment.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Here we show evidence that having an extended nap (\u226530 min) within 4 h of learning helps 6- and 12-month-old infants to retain their memories for new behaviors across a 4- and 24-h delay. These results suggest that infants rely on frequent naps for the formation of long-term memories.</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n<p>Human infants devote the majority of their time to sleeping. However, very little is known about the role of sleep in early memory processing. Here we test 6- and 12-mo-old infants\u2019 declarative memory for novel actions after a 4-h [Experiment (Exp.) 1] and 24-h delay (Exp. 2). Infants in a nap condition took an extended nap (\u226530 min) within 4 h after learning, whereas infants in a no-nap condition did not. A comparison with age-matched control groups revealed that after both delays, only infants who had napped after learning remembered the target actions at the test. Additionally, after the 24-h delay, memory performance of infants in the nap condition was significantly higher than that of infants in the no-nap condition. This is the first experimental evidence to our knowledge for an enhancing role of sleep in the consolidation of declarative memories in the first year of life.</p>\n<p>[end]</p>",

However, little is known regarding the mnemonic mechanisms and relative effectiveness of self-referential strategies in memory-impaired individuals. This study investigated the benefit of a new self-referential strategy known as self-imagination, traditional self-referential strategies, and non-self-referential strategies on free recall in memory-impaired patients with acquired brain injury and in healthy control respondents. The data revealed an advantage of self-imagining in free recall relative to all other strategies in patients and control respondents. Findings also demonstrated that, in the patients only, a self-referential strategy that relied on semantic information in self-knowledge was more effective than a self-referential strategy that relied on autobiographical episodic information. This study provides new evidence to support the clinical utility of self-imagining as a memory strategy and has implications for the future development and implementation of self-referential strategies in memory rehabilitation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[end]</p>",

This benefit may occur because exercise produces a similar physiological response as physical stressors. When administered during consolidation, acute stress, both physical and psychological, consistently enhances episodic memory, particularly memory for emotional materials. Here we investigated whether a single bout of resistance exercise performed during consolidation can produce episodic memory benefits 48 h later. We used a one-leg knee extension/flexion task for the resistance exercise. To assess the physiological response to the exercise, we measured salivary alpha amylase (a biomarker of central norepinephrine), heart rate, and blood pressure. To test emotional episodic memory, we used a remember-know recognition memory paradigm with equal numbers of positive, negative, and neutral IAPS images as stimuli. The group that performed the exercise, the active group, had higher overall recognition accuracy than the group that did not exercise, the passive group. We found a robust effect of valence across groups, with better performance on emotional items as compared to neutral items and no difference between positive and negative items. This effect changed based on the physiological response to the exercise. Within the active group, participants with a high physiological response to the exercise were impaired for neutral items as compared to participants with a low physiological response to the exercise. Our results demonstrate that a single bout of resistance exercise performed during consolidation can enhance episodic memory and that the effect of valence on memory depends on the physiological response to the exercise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[end]</p>",

An Exploration of Stack Overflow</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n<p>Becoming an expert at programming is thought to take an estimated 10,000 hours of deliberate practice. But what happens after that? Do programming experts continue to develop, do they plateau, or is there a decline at some point? A diversity of opinion exists on this matter, but many seem to think that aging brings a decline in adoption and absorption of new programming knowledge. We develop several research questions on this theme, and draw on data from StackOverflow (SO) to address these questions. The goal of this research is to support career planning and staff development for programmers by identifying age-related trends in SO data. We observe that programmer reputation scores increase relative to age well into the 50's, that programmers in their 30's tend to focus on fewer areas relative to those younger or older in age, and that there is not a strong correlation between age and scores in specific knowledge areas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[end]</p>",

From tools\u2019 roles to new learning activities\" (dissertation, University of Eastern Finland)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ABSTRACT</p>\n<p>Learning programming successfully requires not only the acquisition of knowledge, but also skills and attitudes. Program animation tools have been developed for students to help gaining the required skills and knowledge by means of visualizing the various aspects of program execution. Despite developers\u2019 and researchers\u2019 intentions, the learning impact of program animation tools does not correspond to long-term efforts in developing and researching them. While learning impact has mostly been quantitatively evaluated, the process in which students acquire the knowledge and skills using program animation tools is not documented in detail. In particular, the learning impact of Jeliot 3, a program animation tool, has been assessed quantitatively and Jeliot 3 has proved its effectiveness for certain cohorts of students \u2013 those not very strong nor very weak. However, reasons and processes of why Jeliot 3 may improve students\u2019 learning are only suggested in previous research.</p>\n<p>In this thesis, the challenges faced by students when using Jeliot 3 to learn programming have been looked deeply at. The conducted observations have directed the development of new prototypes derived from Jeliot 3, and of new learning activities based on the tool. The research follows a systems development methodology as it is centered in the creation of an efficient artifact to teach programming. Two qualitative studies of English and Tanzanian students using Jeliot 3 prompted the development of several prototypes: Jeliot Adaptive, Jeliot with Explanations, and Jeliot Conflictive Animations. Two of the prototypes, Jeliot with Explanations and Jeliot Conflictive Animations, were empirically evaluated using a between-subject design with pre-tests and post-tests to assess the impact the prototypes had on the students\u2019 learning.</p>\n<p>The qualitative studies revealed the roles the animation tool could take when used by a student learning a new programming concept. Five roles were identified: empty, exploring, confusing, teaching, and evaluating. The roles of the tool were adopted by the students at different stages in the student\u2019s learning path. To promote the importance of the animations and to avoid the empty role of the tool, conflictive animations were devised. Conflictive animations require the student to find the errors contained in the animation, rather than in the code. However, the empirical evaluation only showed a modest gain in effectiveness when learning about class inheritance using Jeliot Conflictive Animation compared to normal Jeliot 3. In another prototype, Jeliot with Explanations, explanations were added to the animations produced by Jeliot 3. It was found that the explanations were more effective when placed after the animation, rather than before the animation.</p>\n<p>The field of program animation has been advancing gradually with iterations of the same idea: improving the interaction and information of animation tools that is presented to the students. These incremental innovations improve the learning impact of the tools, as in the case of Jeliot with Explanations. However, new approaches, like conflictive animations, are needed to advance the field in ways no imagined before. In this thesis, the foundation for future activities and animations based on conflictive animations are laid, and one of the possibilities is explored further: Jeliot ConAn. Conflictive animations, and errors in general, need to be explored further as a way to improve knowledge, skills and attitudes of programming students.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[end]</p>",

Focusing on several European countries at the end of the Cold War, the book shows the digital development was not an exclusively American affair. Local hacker communities appropriated the computer and forged new cultures around it like the hackers in Yugoslavia, Poland and Finland, who showed off their tricks and creating distinct \u201cdemoscenes.\u201d Together the essays reflect a diverse palette of cultural practices by which European users domesticated computer technologies. Each chapter explores the mediating actors instrumental in introducing and spreading the cultures of computing around Europe. More generally, the \u201cludological\u201d element--the role of mischief, humor, and play--discussed here as crucial for analysis of hacker culture, opens new vistas for the study of the history of technology.</p>\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Alberts, Introduction: How European Players Captured the Computer and Created the Scenes, Table of contents (10 chapters)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Veraart, Transnational (Dis)Connection in Localizing Personal Computing in the Netherlands, 1975\u20131990</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lean, \u201cInside a Day You Will Be Talking to It Like an Old Friend\u201d: The Making and Remaking of Sinclair Personal Computing in 1980s Britain</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lekkas, Legal Pirates Ltd: Home Computing Cultures in Early 1980s Greece</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jaki\u0107, Galaxy and the New Wave: Yugoslav Computer Culture in the 1980s</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wasiak, Playing and Copying: Social Practices of Home Computer Users in Poland during the 1980s</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Silvast, Multiple Users, Diverse Users: Appropriation of Personal Computers by Demoscene Hackers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Denker, Heroes Yet Criminals of the German Computer Revolution</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nevejan, How Amsterdam Invented the Internet: European Networks of Significance, 1980\u20131995</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>S\u00f6derberg, Users in the Dark: The Development of a User-Controlled Technology in the Czech Wireless Network Community</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[end]</p>",

Running parallel to this trend are advances in programming environments and teaching methods which aim to make computer science more accessible, and more motivating. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11\u201315 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games.</p>\n<p>Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to \u201cdecode the code\u201d.</p>\n<p>Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12\u201313 year olds in a naturalistic setting.</p>\n<p>Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[end]</p>",

The sample consisted of 250 middle-aged and older adults tested 3 times over 6 years. Structural equation modeling techniques were used to examine the relationships among changes in lifestyle variables and an array of cognitive variables. There was a relationship between changes in intellectually related activities and changes in cognitive functioning. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that intellectually engaging activities serve to buffer individuals against decline. However, an alternative model suggested the findings were also consistent with the hypothesis that high-ability individuals lead intellectually active lives until cognitive decline in old age limits their activities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[end]</p>",

This pattern suggests corresponding continuities of mechanism and process, but it is striking that the fields of cognitive development and cognitive aging make little contact with each other's methods and theories. In this review we examine reasons for this cultural separation, and show how recent findings from both areas fit a framework couched in terms of cognitive representation and control. These two broad factors have very different lifespan trajectories; consideration of their relative growth and decline makes it clear that cognitive aging is not simply 'development in reverse'. This framework is offered in light of recent interest in finding greater continuity throughout the lifespan and creating a more comprehensive explanation of cognitive function and cognitive change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[end]</p>",

This trend has captured the attention of not only affected physicians and researchers but also physicians' patients and the general public. For example, the September 7, 2015, issue of TIME Magazine featured an article titled \u201cLife/Support: Inside the Movement to Save the Mental Health of America's Doctors.\u201d The article addresses many troubling facts about the state of physicians in the United States, including that as many as 400 US physicians are dying by suicide each year, a number comparable, the author points out, with the graduating classes of two or three medical school classes annually.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2015/12/02/best-interest-assessors-have-high-levels-of-job-satisfaction-despite-workload\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2015/12/02/best-interest-assessors-have-high-levels-of-job-satisfaction-despite-workload\">Low burnout among U.K. social workers</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was expected that levels of demand would predict symptoms of burnout given the association between these factors among social workers and other allied health professionals. However, this wasn\u2019t borne out in the research.</p>\n<p>Instead, BIAs reported high levels of wellbeing and job satisfaction, and levels of burnout were significantly below those reported in other caring professions. The pattern of reported burnout indicated that BIAs have low levels of emotional exhaustion and feelings of depersonalisation (the process of becoming emotionally hardened towards service users), but also experienced low levels of personal accomplishment \u2013 this contrasts directly with the burnout profile of most social workers, with a study by Community Care being the latest research to illustrate this.</p>\n<p>Any dissatisfaction that was reported focused on the lack of constructive feedback and, in the case of BIAs employed by a statutory service, pay. Employed BIAs were, however, more likely to experience support from colleagues and managers, which impacted positively on wellbeing and job satisfaction. The research also showed that any ambiguity, however minimal, about BIA work can have a big impact on wellbeing and, in some instances, confusion and some lack of clarity about what had to be done matched the impact of workload on stress levels. One implication of this finding is that BIA training and ongoing continuing professional development needs to be acknowledged as key in how BIAs subsequently experience their work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>Emergency clinicians: <a href=\"https://www.emcare.com/NEWS-EVENTS/EmCare-Blog/November-2015/Four-Strategies-for-Reducing-Emergency-Clinician-B\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.emcare.com/NEWS-EVENTS/EmCare-Blog/November-2015/Four-Strategies-for-Reducing-Emergency-Clinician-B\">https://www.emcare.com/NEWS-EVENTS/EmCare-Blog/November-2015/Four-Strategies-for-Reducing-Emergency-Clinician-B</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Caregivers: <a href=\"http://ravallirepublic.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/article_fe9e71cc-98a9-11e5-92bd-573ed2675900.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ravallirepublic.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/article_fe9e71cc-98a9-11e5-92bd-573ed2675900.html\">http://ravallirepublic.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/article_fe9e71cc-98a9-11e5-92bd-573ed2675900.html</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>U.S. Teachers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/12/02/five-ways-to-eliminate-teacher-burnout.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/12/02/five-ways-to-eliminate-teacher-burnout.html\">http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/12/02/five-ways-to-eliminate-teacher-burnout.html</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.educationworld.com/a_news/teachers-use-tech-find-professional-development-solutions-avoid-burnout-1759102746\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.educationworld.com/a_news/teachers-use-tech-find-professional-development-solutions-avoid-burnout-1759102746\">http://www.educationworld.com/a_news/teachers-use-tech-find-professional-development-solutions-avoid-burnout-1759102746</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Professional athletes: <a href=\"http://www.habseyesontheprize.com/2015/11/30/9807958/the-effects-of-overtraining-and-burnout-elite-athletes-concussion-carey-price-knee-injury\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.habseyesontheprize.com/2015/11/30/9807958/the-effects-of-overtraining-and-burnout-elite-athletes-concussion-carey-price-knee-injury\">http://www.habseyesontheprize.com/2015/11/30/9807958/the-effects-of-overtraining-and-burnout-elite-athletes-concussion-carey-price-knee-injury</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Board-members on FTSE (Financial Times Stock Exchange) corporations: <a href=\"http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/1375132/most-ftse-directors-serious-risk-burnout\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/1375132/most-ftse-directors-serious-risk-burnout\">http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/1375132/most-ftse-directors-serious-risk-burnout</a></p>\n<p>[end]</p>",

Illich is mainly interested in the implicit political goals of an educational system \u2014 to me, that avoids the hard question of the nitty gritty of actually how to teach and learn. He's also prone to ill-informed statements presented for tendentious purposes. Here's one example I know something about:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For three millennia, China protected higher learning through a total divorce between the process of  learning and the privilege conferred by mandarin  examinations. To become a world power and a modern  nation-state, China had to adopt the international style of schooling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is so much that is wrong with this that it would be hard to give a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of it quickly. But for a period of, in round numbers, a millennium and a half, \"China\" was not only a world power but also the world's primary center of technological innovation. The evidence for that claim has been assembled over a period of decades by a number of people doing the hard work of examining details of the history of technology, mostly prominently an embryologist in England named Needham. (I don't know what to make of Illich's phrase \"higher learning\" \u2014 universities were not part of China's decentralized model of intellectual culture in those eras. Probably it doesn't matter since he's making things up.)</p>\n<p>Polemicists, of course, don't need to worry about details. Researchers and educators do. So I'd be inclined to pay more attention to Holt and Papert than Illich.</p>",

All of us reading this discussion of RC's guiding ideas have been at RC as part of its educational mission. Many of us are probably asking ourselves whether we would be interested in applying to work at RC. So I think it would be useful to hear more about how RC actually functions as an educational institution, I mean in the details rather than the philosophy.</p>\n<p>Let me offer you an open and tentative model, just as an initial premise to aid discussion, of what I think learning should accomplish in order to deserve the name education:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>define what people are expected to learn: what skills, what facts, what behaviors, or what have you \u2014 \"curriculum\"</li>\n<li>define practices to be followed or avoided in order for learning to take place \u2014 \"methodology\" (methods of study and instruction)</li>\n<li>define means of deciding whether curriculum and methodology are effective or whether they need to be revised \u2014 \"assessment\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In curriculum and methodology, RC seems to advocate what in Chinese is called <em>f\u00e0ngni\u00fa b\u0101n</em> \u653e\u725b\u73ed \"the classroom in which the students are put out to pasture like cattle\". But how does RC conduct assessment of the cattle's own self-directed pasturing? How does the educational institution determine whether <em>f\u00e0ngni\u00fa b\u0101n</em> has been effective in specific cases and especially whether it is effective in general? And how does it actually determine what curriculum particular cattle have been grazing on, or what grazing methods they are using?</p>\n<p>I think these questions have been of interest to many of us for a long time, but I don't remember seeing them dilated on in the blog. If RC is basically a retreat attached to a recruiting agency, and the retreat fattens cattle before the agency takes them to market, then I don't think assessment of grazing matters much because selling price at market is the real assessment \u2014 the market does the assessing for us. But if RC is an educational institution with an integrated recruiting agency, then RC's assessment practice seems to me a vitally important question in assessing  RC itself. Market selling price aside, is RC effective as an educational institution?</p>\n<p>As I ask myself whether I could be an RC employee, this question is key to understanding what might be required of me, and I imagine it's true for other people as well.</p>",

Today, reform of education through the use of computers is often expressed in terms of supplementing or even replacing schools of the traditional model. </p>\n<p>But RC, with its emphasis on adults dramatically improving their programming skills, really seems to be aimed at something much narrower and more sharply focused than that. I think the sharper focus makes RC's goals something apart from what John Holt advocated, because Holt is overwhelmingly concerned with children's experience. He advocated, among other things, that children should have the right to vote, to buy and sell property, and in general do anything an adult can do \u2014 including attach themselves legally to adults other than their parents (!). It's hard for me to think of his ideas on education outside of the context of his radical views on children. (There's a readable article about him <a href=\"https://mises.org/library/john-holt-libertarian-outsider\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://mises.org/library/john-holt-libertarian-outsider\">here</a>, by the way.)</p>\n<p>Seymour Papert was also focused on children's education (he was closely involved with Piaget for several years at the beginning of his career) but one very interesting idea that came up again and again in his writing was that programming principles, like other concepts, can become \"tools to think with\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They are powerful ideas that organize thinking and problem solving. (<em>Mindstorms</em> (New York: Basic Books, 1980) p. 132).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a few words, he advocated children having programming skills as a way of developing those tools for themselves, and I think that translates to the intellectual growth of adults pretty well, too.</p>",

On that point, here's an interesting sprouted barleycorn from Neil Selwyn, \"School 2.0: Rethinking the Future of Schools in the Digital Age\" (A. Jimoyiannis (ed.), <em>Research on e-Learning and ICT in Education</em>, (New York: Springer, 2012), Chapter 1 [let me know off-Zulip if you'd like to see a copy]):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The linkages between current educational technology thinking and the arguments advanced by writers such as Illich 40 years earlier reflect the highly ideological nature of debate over the schools and digital technology. Illich himself was a politically fluid but essentially anarchistic thinker who in later years argued against the entire notion of \u201ceducation\u201d altogether. Indeed, he reasoned that as people have historically always known many things without enforced and compulsory forms of education then current generations therefore would do better to learn outside the aegis of the state altogether. Of course, the intentions of many commentators on education and technology may well be rooted in similar counter-cultural sensibilities \u2013 especially among more idealistic elements of the computer programming community. Yet one of the key differences between the original deschooling debates of the 1970s and those in the 2010s is the diversity of often conflicting ideological standpoints of those interests that are currently arguing for such change. As such, the people arguing for the digitally driven deschooling of 2010s\u2019 society are doing so for a variety of reasons and rationales, not all counter-cultural or anarchic in intention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That sounds considerably more like RC, eh?</p>",

Look at the change in line-spacing from p. 2 to p. 3. The underlined words were all typed first and then the typist went back and typed the underline key under the whole word. These were all costs entailed in producing typewritten text. Revising a paper meant typing it out again and again. If it appeared typeset in print, that was also entered manually by someone else \u2014 sometimes using a keyboard connected to a linotype machine, but sometimes using \"pieces\" of type that were \"set\" by hand.</p>\n<p>Think of this every time you see any writing that comes from before 1985.</p>\n<p>Every office hired professional typists who could do this work. Many creative people couldn't type at all, themselves, and depended on professional typists to turn their hand-written documents into neat-looking material like this. It wasn't possible to typeset your own writing in a word processor or LaTeX, but if you put in the time and effort you could do a good job with a typewriter. At universities, theses and dissertations sometimes had to be typed without error using special forms that regulated the size of the margins precisely. When I say \"had to\" I mean that the thesis-submission office had officials who would examine each page of your thesis and give it back to you for reworking if there were hand-additions or if you infringed on the margin, etc. etc. Universities always had a whole bunch of \"copy places\" nearby, and you could find ads for professional typists there and in the libraries. </p>\n<p>Notice that the <a href=\"http://www.papert.org/articles/SomePoeticAndSocialCriteriaForEducationDesign.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.papert.org/articles/SomePoeticAndSocialCriteriaForEducationDesign.html\">HTML version I posted earlier</a> doesn't reproduce precisely the publication information at the bottom of p. 2. At least they've retained the typo in \"another purpose then the fun\".</p>",

So overall I thought the idea was good: technology is a dynamic medium that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>create[s] an environment in which interesting actions can be produced and controlled</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This feels really solid to me. I did, however, object to the notion that pen and paper were static. Yes, in the most straightforward usage they are... you create a mark and aren't fully able to explore. But I don't think that that means that the learning is static. I think most of the dynamic interaction in a classroom can (and maybe should) take place between students and/or between mentor figures like teachers or just more experienced learners. I think you often see that interpersonal stuff lost with the introduction of technology which removes the dynamic nature of _conversation_</p>\n<p>I do really like that he acknowledges that tech inherently wont solve the problem though:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of them try to improve matter by having the children do the same same sums on computer terminals</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that ^ is an over-exaggerated version of a problem that runs really deep: namely that the tools can't create the conversation component and that the best learning is really a product of being creative and curious</p>",

Stewart Brand was the founder of the <em>Quarterly</em>, and he's worth looking into. He had been inspired by Native American ideals and by Buckminster Fuller, and was one of the people responsible for the <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em>. The <em>Catalog</em> was a seminal influence on many people of the half-generation just before mine, and also on me and some of my closest friends. I used to have a huge stack of <em>CoEvolution Quarterly</em> issues, but I gave them away when I went off to graduate school \u2014 no room for them.

But recently I've been reading a John Holt book about adult education, and he holds the words <em>guide</em> and <em>guidance</em> should carry certain freight. In order to avoid that freight I've debated using <em>shepherding</em> for the sense that I mean and that I think you also mean.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"sumanah@fastmail.com\" data-user-id=\"2909\">@Sumana Harihareswara (F2'14)</span>, I hope what I say below doesn't seem to deny the value of your reflections on your own state of mind. I just want to point out that RC in neither its present nor its past incarnations represents all of John Holt's thinking about adult education. </p>\n<p>Holt praises certain kinds of \"s-chool\" (his word for the sort of educational organization he approves of) as \"very tightly and rigidly structured,\" imposing \"the most intense and inflexible discipline,\" and \"demanding, intensive, formal, and tightly organized.\" \"The discipline is exact and intense.\" \"As long as [students] stay in the class, they have no choices at all.\" Holt's key objection to \"S-chools\" (capital-S schools, the sort of educational institution he <em>doesn't</em> approve of) is not that instruction is inflexible and denies students choice; he is concerned with \"the degree to which the students <em>are free to choose</em> to spend their time with [the t-eacher (DPB: lower case, the kind Holt approves of)] or not, do what he is doing, use his help, listen to and accept or reject his ideas.\" Holt wants students to be able to choose to, or not to, go to a school \u2014 how the school or the teacher chooses to run the curriculum seems to be the school or the teacher's business, and if you don't like it, you should be free to leave.</p>\n<p>\"The difference between s-chools and S-chools has nothing whatever to do with pedagogy, with philosophies of education, ways of teaching, curricula, materials, and so forth. \u2026 The only choice society offer[s students is], go to this school or some other school. Any school which is part of such a system of coercion is a S-chool.\"</p>",

I'd like to see discussion of what people come to RC expecting, educationally, and what RC can reasonably be expected to supply. The caveat is that for RC to \"supply\" something doesn't necessarily mean one of the staff taking me aside to serve it to me on bone china \u2014 RC's current model is for most guidance to come from other RCers, with the staff perhaps serving to regulate and encourage some of those interactions.</p>\n<p>I originally applied to RC in the late Fall of 2012. It was a rather different organization then in some ways. There wasn't yet a community gelled by Zulip, for instance, and active staff guidance was a strong feature of the batch: by the middle of my first batch there were five facilitators for 43 batchlings, plus a different resident on site every week. In memory, the things I came to RC hoping for were, first to last:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An idea of what sorts of jobs I could reasonably hope to educate myself toward, together with some oversight in that education.</li>\n<li>Authoritative advice about diverse best practices in programming and related areas. </li>\n<li>A \"cohort\" of fellow strivers, such as one might find in a business school class. (Bootcamps and their language were not yet part of the  mindset of programming education.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don't think that covers everything everyone wants from RC, but I'd wager many people come wanting at least one of those items very badly.</p>\n<p>Sebastian's \"good security habits\" certainly falls under the second item. But the RC staff have always declined to curate advice of that sort. So how can interested people in the community curate such advice? \u2014 (remembering the chaos of the Wiki and the library).</p>",

In a classroom setting, the vertical structure encourages thinking only from the point of view of the teacher, or at best from the several points of view that the teacher has considered.</p>\n<p>I prefer to learn about how to think about how to do things, rather than to learn a prescriptive way of how things should be done. I get that this view seems to be in conflict with my tendency to make bold declarative statements about how I think things should be done (\"we have an ethical obligation to develop good security habits\"). This is (one of) my learning style(s). Hearing/participating in a debate about how things should be done is the easiest way for me to learn to think about how things should be done: I don't just get to hear diverse opinions, I get to hear reasons, evidence, arguments for all of them: a dialectic of best practices (or whatever other topic).</p>\n<p>My argumentative learning style is, I think, one of the many reasons I was never able to succeed in \"traditional\" educational settings. I'm not alone: I know a lot of very smart people who did quite poorly in school and/or university. The Recurse Center is the only educational institution I've found where I feel like learning here is easier than learning by myself (modulo the internet) at home. I'm sure I'm not the only Recurser who feels that way. I hope that any discussion of what education RC should provide doesn't overlook us.</p>\n<p>A few of the features of RC that make this space work for me, in no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No teachers</li>\n<li>No curriculum</li>\n<li>Job search/interview stuff is optional and isn't shoved in my face</li>\n<li>Broad diversity of identity, origin, background, perspective, opinion, and ability among Recursers</li>\n<li>A non-competitive, cooperative culture</li>\n</ul>",

I've been reading John Holt's <em>Instead of Education: Ways to help people do things better</em> (1976). Holt has some thoughts about an idea that has motivated me for a long time: how do I enable independent learners to get training in subjects in which I have proficiency but that I may never have a chance to teach them in person?</p>\n<p>In Chapter 7, Section \"Feedback without a Teacher,\" Holt asserts \"it must always be the first and central task of any teacher to help the student become independent of him, to learn to be his own teacher. The true teacher must always be trying to work himself out of a job.\" (p. 66)</p>\n<p>Chapter 8: \"I was once very interested in the idea of teacherless textbooks, particularly in Math. Math teachers seemed so unable to answer most students' questions that I thought, why can't we have a textbook that will answer them?\" (p. 87). He concludes that \"[we would] have to explain the explanations, and then explain them, and so on. The reason why the human t-eacher is at best so infinitely quicker and more flexible than a book or machine, is that with a t-eacher (but not a T-eacher) the student can begin with what he knows and what he wants to find out. He can ask the question <em>he</em> wants, and if the answer is not clear, do whatever he needs to do to make it clear\" (p. 87).</p>\n<p>I like that he considered the idea, but his argument against it seems to me both weak and dogmatic.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Choreographer Twyla Tharp put on six performances of an in-progress work at the Harlem School for the Arts this Spring, and I managed to get into two of them. At the end of each show she had a few audience volunteers go up on stage to learn one or another of \"The One Hundreds\", one volunteer with one or another member of the cast. While that was happening and before the volunteers performed what they had learned, she opened the floor to questions, and after all the urgent questions petered out I asked the function of The One Hundreds in her studio and outreach.</p>\n<p>The most interesting part of her answer was an aside \u2013 that she preferred to talk about \"apprenticeship\" rather than \"mentorship\", in order to put emphasis where it belongs, on the learner.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As for The One Hundreds, she said she created them \"the first time I left New York for good\". Some text on line suffices to the factual detail that she described:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Inspired by legendary baseball player Sandy Koufax, Tharp noticed that each baseball play took approximately 11 seconds. She then began crafting her own 11-second phrases, culminating with her creation of The One Hundreds, a dance that has received critical acclaim and has become a core part of Tharp\u2019s educational and training programs.

She was pregnant, she was living on an upstate farm where wildflowers covered the hillside and clouds floated by, and the three extraordinary dancers who made up her young company\u2014Sara Rudner, Rose Marie Wright, and Isabel Garcia-Lorca\u2014were right at hand whenever she wanted them. Feeling blessed and ambitious, she made The One Hundreds, and earlier this month she staged the piece at Battery Park as the final event in the River to River Festival. Like Bill T. Jones, she was evoking phantoms with this performance, but she was determined to make them participate to the hilt. Tharp has a lot of respect for the past, but only as long as it pays its own way.</p>\n<p>The One Hundreds was created on four people but it takes a hundred of them to do it right. First, two dancers, in unison, perform 100 eleven-second phrases. Then five dancers do twenty each. Then a hundred people materialize\u2014volunteers, mostly nondancers, each of whom has learned a single phrase\u2014and they do them simultaneously, so the piece ends in a stunning blur that\u2019s over almost before you can take it in. The point is one that Tharp has been making over and over for years: Dance is as natural as wildflowers, and we all have a place on the hillside.

I clearly saw Balanchine's dancers were the quickest and the most elegant, working with a commitment to dancing that was purer than ABT's dancers', who talked much of the time about their careers \u2014 casting, tours, and overtime. Balanchine's dancers talked about the excitement of new ballets. But fortunately his school was closed to the general public; had I been allowed access to Balanchine, I probably would have signed up for life and never developed my own idiom.

Year after year students in the program kept making variations of this (without realizing it was done before). Event as inputs became sophisticated, like the Kinect over a simple IR sensor, the core idea of the projects stayed the same. Year after year, it never got boring to see people's learning paths to these projects. They were always subtly different and the learning path that each one followed brought laughter and smiles! </p>\n<p>Most of these projects were never really recorded officially by the program, and if I remember right, every year students would ask for an archive of projects, to which Red Burns (the founder of the program) would say no. There was something to the ephemeral nature of the projects that allowed people to learn. </p>\n<p>I think subconsciously people put too much emphasis on originality, and my take away was that the program was trying to encourage folks to spend more time learning rather than worrying about being original. This is a huge digression... so back to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"lindzey@gmail.com\" data-user-id=\"2131\">@Laura Lindzey (S'13)</span>'s questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What would a usefully usable archive look like for you? Are you wanting inspiration for resources? Are you wanting to make it possible to follow an existing curriculum? Are you wanting incoming RCers to be reassured that valid and valuable paths don't always look linear?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Before the workshop, I spent a solid 45 minutes fighting with basic setup, and eventually managed to track down the problem: I had a space in the path to the code I was setting up, and react native build scripts use some kind of naive string parsing to configure a project that blows up on that.  </p>\n<p>This seems like the kind of knowledge (\"hey, no spaces in your react native path/this is one possibly way you can get this obscure error message\") that it would be useful to have a systematic way, beyond personal blog posts and documentation PRs, to put out in the world...</p>",

Why does it bother you that they're ephemeral?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'd like them as a curated/tested starting point for learning new stuff. There is lots of knowledge distributed across the web, but discovery is really poor. Search engines don't do the job well. There are textbooks and courses available, but then each individual is left to do their own searches and fend for themselves in deciphering which materials might be worthwhile. It bothers me because the meandering Googling feels like redundant work.</p>\n<p>The other thing I was thinking about as I was writing the post was the loss of the knowledge transferred during sessions. For example, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"code@saul.pw\" data-user-id=\"100791\">@Saul Pwanson (SP2'17)</span> ran an OS practicum during his batch. And now that he's gone, if a Recurser in a new batch wants to learn about OSes, there's no guarantee that someone in their batch will be as capable or as generous as Saul was in creating that. So it feels like a loss that people in later batches can't directly benefit from the work that went into Saul creating that. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>an alternate view might be that the curricula themselves aren't of value, it's the process of generating one customized for yourself that has value</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think ultimately the question of which is of value is better answered by each Recurser, rather than generalized. For me personally \u2013 is there a skill to be developed in finding out how to develop one's own curriculum? Sure. But it's not the skill I wanted to work on at RC to become a better programmer. I wanted to do machine learning (which I ended up doing by following along with a MOOC). I believe Recursers may get more out of RC by spending less time searching for primary sources and more time actually consuming those sources, and that caching previous Recursers' efforts would assist in that greatly. If someone sees value in generating their own curriculum, then the existence of a repository of previous approaches in no way prevents them from getting that value by starting over from scratch. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What would a usefully usable archive look like for you? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a consumer of the archive, I'd like to be able to search by topic and find one or more suggested sequences of readings, resources, exercises, and projects as done by previous Recursers, ideally with commentary. This will understandably start out very incomplete, but in aggregate over a few years of batches, I suspect it would become formidable. I'm not suggesting it be git-like, but I find the concepts of forking and branching to be interesting when considering how Recursers would make individual modifications. (As would, say, up-voting).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you wanting inspiration for resources? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Absolutely this would be a part. Let RC be the starting point for a search, instead of Google.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you wanting to make it possible to follow an existing curriculum? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think at the limit I'd hope that the archive would reach a point where there are fully realized curriculum to follow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you wanting incoming RCers to be reassured that valid and valuable paths don't always look linear?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm wanting incoming RCers to be able to share in the rich collective knowledge gathered by previous batches and alumni, and to be able to add to it from their own past, present, and future experiences. </p>\n<p>I don't think that curricula or an archive is inherently linear. I think one of the main benefits of the archiving is being able to see the myriad ways previous Recursers have approached related questions. I think RC makes it clear that there isn't one true way. And in fact, there are many ways (and here are some of the ways, as followed by others before us).</p>",

My read of your comments infers that if there were an archive of the \"ITP wave\", then new students would be deterred from replicating it. I never really noticed a pressure for originality at RC \u2013 how many people have re-built bittorrent clients or blogs or operating systems and hello worlds? :)</p>\n<p>Another philosophical question is whether the uncertainty and discomfort that some Recursers (myself included) experience in their first few weeks as they try to chart a course toward their goals is a core part of the RC experience. Is overcoming that a key part of the journey? Or would some benefit from getting a jumpstart?</p>\n<p>And I want to bring something back up, because it hasn't surfaced in any of my answers so far: a major influence on my thinking here is the question of how to expand RC's influence. The question of how RC can share the experience with the world outside the in-person retreat is one that I heard asked a number of times during my batch. RC is not an ivory tower, but the collective effort is generating a lot of knowledge. So the open-source academia aspect is an interesting one.</p>",

For me RC being a space for more of an 'ephemeral' type of knowledge creation doesn't lose anything from some sort of effort to organize and systematize the knowledge creation. And it doesn't have to be a very hard outline of organizing and compartmentalizing pieces of knowledge. I actually think there are great opportunities already in place. </p>\n<p>For e.g. 3 points of knowledge sharing at RC happen In Zulip checkins, Thursday presentations and everyday informal presentations. One idea could be some tool that can catalogue these knowledge sharing points. Even a simple thing where you can 'push' your presentation slide (however informal) to a central point with simple tagging of technology or topic. You can do the same with any github project you finish or tutorials/seminars you give to other Recursers.  It could even be something similar to what to Blagregattor does for Recurser blog posts...</p>",

[...] Worrying about whether you did the right thing, while painful enough, is less painful than worrying about the right thing to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We take the word \"normal,\" meaning <em>usual</em>, what happens most of the time, and turn it into <em>proper</em>, <em>correct</em>, <em>desirable</em>, what ought to happen all the time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We act as if we thought this tool of language were perfect, and children had only to learn to use it correctly--i.e., as we do. In fact, it is in many ways a most imperfect tool. If we were more aware of its imperfections, of the many ways in which it does not fit the universe it attempts to describe, of the paradoxes and contradictions built into it, then we could warn the children, help them see where words and experience did not fit together, and perhaps show them ways of using language that would to some extent rise above its limitations.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The hard part is deciding how much infrastructure to devote to that work. </p>\n<p>The smallest unit of activity is the individual learner, but individual learners are often ill-informed (and susceptible to misinformation) about what will enable them to learn what they want to learn. They're also prone to misgauge what they have or haven't learned, and even motivated to be dishonest with themselves about having learned more than they have.</p>\n<p>A lot of those problems can be solved by making a teacher or guide part of the process. But then teachers need to be evaluated, too, for their effectiveness in those responsibilities, and if the learning takes part in a school, it's generally the school administration that oversees the teachers.</p>\n<p>The school, of course, may have conflicts of interest of its own. And so outside assessors get involved.</p>\n<p>Who assesses the system itself?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The push to quantify undergraduate learning is about a century old, but the movement really took off in the 1980s. The assessment boom coincided \u2014 not, I think, by accident \u2014 with the decision of state legislatures all over the country to reduce spending on public universities and other social services. That divestment continued, moving more of the cost of higher education onto students. (These students are often graduates of underfunded high schools that can\u2019t prepare them for college in the first place.) It was politically convenient to hold universities accountable for all this, rather than to scrutinize neoliberal austerity measures.</p>\n<p>In 2006, the Commission on the Future of Higher Education, convened by Margaret Spellings, the secretary of education at the time, issued a scathing critique of universities. \u201cEmployers report repeatedly that many new graduates they hire are not prepared to work, lacking the critical thinking, writing and problem-solving skills needed in today\u2019s workplaces,\u201d the commission\u2019s report complained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's an interesting article.</p>",

That being said, I'm probably not the target audience for this, so it may not matter.</p>\n<p>It'd also be cool to include non-js code examples as well - maybe python and c?

Quite the contrary: I can usually find some way to teach a student who actually takes an interest in the material, regardless of their apparent level of \"IQ\" or whatever other bad factor analysis construct we want to pretend is real this week. But one thing that I've observed is that avidity is a problem <em>to the other students</em> --- at least in the culture I teach in now (and which I clash with, personality-wise, in many respects), the U.S. Midwest, it seems like there's a \"nail that sticks up gets hammered down\" phenomenon which causes other students to resent the avid.</p>",

This article addresses the long-standing question of why students and faculty remain resistant to active learning. Comparing passive lectures with active learning using a randomized experimental approach and identical course materials, we find that students in the active classroom learn more, but they feel like they learn less. We show that this negative correlation is caused in part by the increased cognitive effort required during active learning. Faculty who adopt active learning are encouraged to intervene and address this misperception, and we describe a successful example of such an intervention.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Could students be less into active learning because it asks a lot of them in a university environment in which they're already having a lot asked of them through tons of courses and a focus on good grades? I wonder if they'd feel differently if the active learning class was the only thing they had to do?</p>\n<p>I also found parts of this really relatable to the feelings that I find coming up whenever I'm self directed. As soon as I do quantitative measurements I realize I'm getting a lot done, but otherwise I feel like maybe I'm getting nothing done at all. It's funny to have both those feelings at once!</p>",

I do not have enough teaching assistant support and I am supposed to give programming assignments and quizzes etc. The university uses a variant of moodle which works OK for quizzes but not for exams and there is a huge cheating problem and the students dont hesitate to cheat in in class quizzes for instance. I wonder if anyone here knows of a moodle like programming assignment grading system similar to leetcode. For plagiarism check I guess I could use a Stanford tool called moss. Also for exams and quizzes any suggestion will be appreciated with such a large class audience paper based exams are too time consuming. Thank you.</p>",

I'm not complaining, but I'm also not entirely sure why! </p>\n<p>The graphics are at best mid-90s quality, it's buggy as hell, and the conceit that success in magic battles and treasure collection is contingent on answering math questions correctly seems pretty lame.  And yet... they somehow have her doing 7th grade algebra.  She and her friends text constantly, correcting each other on details of game mythology.  Yesterday evening, there was a live-stream \"behind the scenes\" look at an upcoming release, and she absorbed this - again, texting constantly - with an intensity that warmed the cockles of my nerdy heart.  There's no social aspect to the gaming itself - there are some canned, good-natured pings possible, but no free text whatsoever. </p>\n<p>The game is also not particularly good at actual teaching, so there are frequent emergency tutorials.  I find these fulfilling, but they're definitely not her favorite aspect of the process.  She's more into enumerating the powers of various magical animals.  </p>\n<p>So, with caveats and bafflement, I guess I recommend Prodigy.  It's nominally free, but various features (along with respite for advertising for them) are obtained for $50/year.  Oh, and the security is horrifyingly weak, but there's so little to be gained from hacking an account that I guess it doesn't matter.</p>",

When I was 16 I worked on a big governor's campaign. And we were reliable volunteers and we were putting in serious hours. I felt like we should have been leaders, but that never happened. They said, 'Do your call lists, knock on doors\u2014let us do the thinking.' Now, on the Obama campaign, when I see people like me and my friends used to be, we turn them around and say, 'Well hey, here's how to be a community organizer. Let me help you be a community organizer.' And then they go out and they get people to be their coordinators. And then we tell those new coordinators, 'Build yourself a team and be organizers too.' There's no end to it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>",

We had from the beginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret, which was pretty well observ'd; the intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might find it difficult to refuse. I was one of those who were against any addition to our number, but, instead of it, made in writing a proposal, that every member separately should endeavor to form a subordinate club, with the same rules respecting queries, etc., and without informing them of the connection with the Junto. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was wrong -- 12 people, not ~50.</p>",

This review found 839 assessments of distributed practice in 317 experiments located in 184 articles. Effects of spacing (consecutive massed presentations vs. spaced learning episodes) and lag (less spaced vs. more spaced learning episodes) were examined, as were expanding interstudy interval (ISI) effects. Analyses suggest that ISI and retention interval operate jointly to affect final-test retention; specifically, the ISI producing maximal retention increased as retention interval increased. Areas needing future research and theoretical implications are discussed.</p>",
