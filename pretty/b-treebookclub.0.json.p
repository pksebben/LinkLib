Is it a day's work? An hour's work? I would be unwise to commit, in the absence of either knowledge or motive.<br>\n<br>\nBut I have two ideas:<br>\n<br>\nFirst, I don't think three people is positively required to benefit from reading the book. If you're excited, I think you should do it, with two people or even alone. <br>\n<br>\nSecond, while I probably can't join you in a deep plunge into this pool, I can do something else for you \u2014 if you're interested. I would like to suggest that you write a pr\u00e9cis of each section of the book. I will be glad to read it carefully and interact with you about it. Doing this kind of careful reading and giving measured critical feedback for other people was part of my first career, and on the active side I still write pr\u00e9cis and outlines of books and articles that I find hard going. It's an excellent way both to deepen your own understanding and make the topic easier for others to grasp.<br>\n<br>\nThe point of a pr\u00e9cis is to summarize the author's high-level ideas with enough depth and enough clarity that most of the nutrition of the book can be absorbed from the pr\u00e9cis alone. If the author makes an argument over several pages, the gist of that argument should be recoverable \u2014 with clarity \u2014 from your summary in a few lines. If the author lists eighteen ways of doing something and comments on each, it should be possible to find out from your pr\u00e9cis the most important several of those ways and the most trenchant of the comments. It can be done in outline form or in paragraphs, but the salient goal is to be terse without losing clarity, and to produce something that can stand alone without being incoherent. The secondary point is that carrying out this act of reduction forces you to fully understand what you are reading and commit yourself to stating what the author means.<br>\n<br>\nIt's very easy to read something hard and think we've understood it when in fact we haven't really; writing a pr\u00e9cis and subjecting it to gentle criticism is the best way I know to ensure that we actually do understand what we've read. <br>\n<br>\nIf you are willing to do this, I am willing to read your work and respond to it in a serious and professional manner. The advantage to you would be that I would serve as a sort of goad to your getting a useful summary document out of your labor in reading and thinking. The advantage to me would be the chance to interact with these ideas without having to read the book outright.</p>",

            "content": "<p>The Gr\u00e4fe book says (Sec. 2.1, p. 213):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The original design for B-trees has user data in all nodes. The design used much more commonly today holds user data only in the leaf nodes. The root node and the branch nodes contain only separator keys that guide the search algorithm to the correct leaf node. These separator keys may be equal to keys of current or former data, but the only requirement is that they can guide the search algorithm.</p>\n<p>This design has been called B\u207a-tree but it is nowadays the default design when B-trees are discussed. The value of this design is that deletion can affect only leaf nodes, not branch nodes and that separator keys in branch nodes can be freely chosen within the appropriate key range.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are two key differences between a vanilla B-tree and a B+-tree:</p>\n<p>1. As mentioned, B+-tree holds data only the leaf nodes; the branch nodes are used for navigation only.<br>\n 2. In a B+-tree, the leaf nodes are a linked list independent of the branch nodes. Comer explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In particular, leaf nodes are usually linked together left-to-right, as shown. The linked list of leaves is referred to as the sequence set. Sequence set links allow easy sequential processing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nowhere that I can see does Gr\u00e4fe discuss this linking of leaves. However, Gr\u00e4fe does discuss something called a \"B\u02e1\u2071\u207f\u1d4f-tree\", involving a pointer between two nodes on the same level (Sec. 4.6, pp. 283-86). However, as far as I can see, this is used only for load-balancing between branch nodes in the case of overflow.</p>",

And he adds (p. 16:4): </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We also ignore many other variations of B-trees here. This includes what Comer [1979], following Knuth, calls B*-trees, that is, attempting to merge an overflowing node with a sibling rather than splitting it immediately. <strong>We ignore</strong> whether or not underflow is recognized and acted upon by load balancing and merging nodes, whether or not empty nodes are removed immediately or ever, <strong>whether or not leaf nodes form a singly or doubly linked list</strong> using physical pointers (page identifiers) or logical boundaries (fence keys equal to separators posted in the parent node during a split), whether suffix truncation is employed when posting a separator key [Bayer and Unterauer 1977], whether prefix truncation or any other compression is employed on each page, and the type of information associated with B-tree keys. <strong>Most of these issues have little or no bearing on locking in B-trees, with the exception of sibling pointers, as indicated in the following where appropriate.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the only place where \"sibling pointers\" are mentioned is this (p. 16:9):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026 <strong>\"pointer chasing\" applies not only to parent-child pointers but also to neighbor pointers, such as, in a chain of leaf pages during a range scan or while searching for the key to lock in key range locking</strong> (see the following). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and \"the following\" turns out to be, again, a reference to \"B\u02e1\u2071\u207f\u1d4f-trees\".

            "content": "<p>Donald Knuth, \"Multiway Trees\", <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> (2nd ed.), Sec. 6.2.4 (Vol. 3, pp. 481-9, n.b. exercises pp. 490-1). The main discussion of B-trees (\"<em>B</em>-trees\"; Knuth is very particular about typography*) specifies (p. 483):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026A \"leaf\" is a terminal node, one with no children. Since the leaves carry no information, we may regard them as external nodes that aren't really in the tree, so that \u039b is a pointer to a leaf. [DPB: In this book \u039b stands for \"pointer to null address\", Sec. 2.1, Vol. 1, p. 234.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the B\u207a-tree is covered under subsection \"Refinements and variations\" (Vol. 3, pp. 486-9), and Knuth modifies the general definition (p. 486):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We might use a completely different node format in each level of the tree, and we might also store information in the leaves. Sometimes the keys form only a small part of the records in a file, and in such cases it is a mistake to store the entire records in the branch nodes near the root of the tree; this would make <em>m</em> too small for efficient multiway branching.</p>\n<p>We can therefore reconsider Fig. 30, imagining that all the records of the file are now stored in the leaves, and that only a few of the keys have been duplicated in the branch nodes. Under this interpretation, the leftmost leaf contains all records whose key is \u2264 011; the leaf marked <em>A</em> contains all records whose key satisfies</p>\n<p>439 &lt; <em>K</em> \u2264 449;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(8)</p>\n<p>and so on. Under this interpretation the leaf nodes grow and split just as the branch nodes do, except that a record is never passed up from a leaf to the next level. Thus the leaves are always at least half filled to capacity. A new key enters the nonleaf part of the tree whenever a leaf splits. If each leaf is linked to its successor in symmetric order [DPB: I think this means a doubly-linked list], we gain the ability to traverse the file both sequentially and randomly in an efficient and convenient manner. This variant has become known as a <em>B\u207a</em>-tree. [DPB: This last sentence is all that was added from the first edition of the text.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've been puzzling about this for some time \u2014 wouldn't linking leaves symmetrically always require some further traversal of the tree, whenever a leaf is inserted or deleted? But none of the descriptions I've seen include this traversal. Why?</p>\n<p>Thinking about it for a while, I now see that every insertion begins as the splitting of an existing leaf into either two leaves or its conversion into a branch node and spawning of new leaves. In either case, all the pointers needed are already to hand. No new traversal of the tree is needed. Deletions, too, require no new traversal of the tree \u2014 all the pointers needed are already to hand.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>* On p. 489 of this section, Knuth remarks that \"Two of the most interesting developments of the basic <em>B</em>-tree strategy have unfortunately been given almost [DPB: !] identical names: \"<em>SB</em>-trees\" and \"SB-trees\".</p>",
