Turing himself defined others sorts of computers, or so I understand, from reading the wikipedia page on hypercomputation... Or continuous computation ? Like the <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_de_Blum-Shub-Smale\">Smale Machine</a></p>\n<p>Also this begs the question: is computer science a science ? For me a science means that you can have experiments, hypothesis - that you are following the scientific method. Mathematics in this definition is not a science. So if CS is a part of math, is CS still a science ?</p>\n<p>For many this (the status of invention vs discovery, the relation of CS to math, what is a science even) bears no importance because it will not change reality - to this, I will invoke the Popper/Kuhn argument, and might want to try to defend the following position: it might not change what could possibly happens, but it will change our current understanding of what is possible, and hence change what we build or not build, what research we take on, and so fort - so it will change our reality. does this make sense ?</p>",

            "content": "<p>Ernst Mayr in his book \"This is Biology\" defends the position that biology is a natural science even though it is extremely rare to have experiments under lab conditions the way that physics does. In fact, he kinda calls out Kuhn for basing most of his discourse around physical sciences like physics and geology, and he says that this excludes other legitimate ways of doing science (like biology). <br>\nThe Turing machine (or the von Neumann architecture for that matter) are very much not the only models of universal computers. My personal favorites are the ones that come from cellular automata (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness#Examples\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness#Examples</a>).<br>\nI don't think mathematics is a science, and I think much of CS is a subset of mathematics. But these are just my personal definitions that let me sleep at night. I don't claim that they are correct. One way that I could be convinced that CS is more-like-science than it is more-like-math is if you are studying about models of computation that happen in the natural world. Certain behaviors of starling murmurations and schools of fish definitely have a distinct sense that they are responding to some input and computing some kind of local optimum of an answer.<br>\nAnother way of looking at this is to think of information as a fundamental part of the physical universe, much like energy or matter. C\u00e9sar Hidalgo in his book \"Why Information Grows\" takes this point of view. So I would say that whatever part of CS is studying (the computation of) information as a phenomenon of the physical world is doing natural science and not math.</p>",
