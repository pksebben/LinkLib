[\u00a7 158.] (a) [Unfair labor practices by employer] It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer--<br>\n[...]<br>\n (2) to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it: [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My impression is that this is intended to forestall company influence on the union, which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_union#United_States\">this oddly maybe-company-unions-should-make-a-comeback Wikipedia article section</a> backs up:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Company unions were common in the United States during the early twentieth century, but were outlawed under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act \u00a78(a)(2) so that trade unions could remain independent of management. All labor organizations would have to be freely elected by the workforce, without interference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is why the favorable outcome in the US is less \"the company is encouraging a union\" and more \"the company voluntarily recognized the union/did not invest in union busting\", as with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/online-code-collaboration-tool-glitch-votes-to-unionize/\">the recent unionization of Glitch workers</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cOur mission is to make the tech world a better place by enabling all coders to create web apps they love in a fast, friendly, and safe way,\u201d the company said in a comment offered to TechCrunch. \u201cToday, that means voluntarily supporting our employees\u2019 decision to unionize.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>",
