I expected you to do more direct comparison for someone learning Svelte, but maybe the real goal of showing a technique to understand Svelte better would have been more clear in the context of a Svelte conference.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure showing the videos as part of the talk works well, but that could have been because at some point my video and audio playback got out of sync (refresh fixed it so I think it was on my end somehow).</p>",
