(Brownie points if you find any errors in my GR.)</p>\n<p>I was a classroom language teacher for 25 years, and a persistent foible I've noticed is that many people prefer to use ready-made flashcards, answers to problems sets, and so on. My view is that the extra time spent in making flashcard sets oneself, or working through problems without a solution to consult, pays off much more than the amount of extra time spent at first. So I'm offering to give private help to anyone who wants it, as an incentive to work through the material first-hand.</p>",
