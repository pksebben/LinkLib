I'm a user of the project <a href=\"https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze\">SCM_Breeze</a> which is a terminal aliasing collection around Git to ease the UX of using git from the terminal.

I've expressed interest to him in becoming that human today through an email and am waiting for a response.</p>\n<p>My initial thoughts are to create an github organization and move the root project there. The creator and I could then share management and write access to the repository, PR &amp; Issues tracker, and wiki. It would also give the option of splitting the project out into multiple repos if so desired.</p>\n<p>- Any drawbacks to this idea that I've missed?<br>\n- Are there other ways you've experienced this process take place?</p>",

It makes it clear that the original author is no longer the primary maintainer, and it simplifies a lot of things if your project gets larger. I've had lots of good experiences with github orgs, and the largest I started (KSP-CKAN) has dozens of core contributors and hundreds of fringe contributors.</p>\n<p>The other ways I've seen transfers done are: (a) adding the new maintainer as a contributor, but leaving the repo where it is.  This works fine if it's a small project, but can still be confusing as to who's wearing the maintainer hat. (b) Having the new maintainer fork the repo, and do the new work there. It's even more confusing for everyone, but has some applications when the original maintainer is completely AWOL.</p>\n<p>So A+ endorsement for an organisation. Whether you make that or the old maintainer does depends on the humans involved. (In my experience the human factors of maintainership transfer can be much more tricky to navigate than the technical ones.)</p>",
