You can find them at the first annual Small File Media Festival! </p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic is showing us how dependent people are on streaming media. Streaming media currently is responsible for over 1% of our global carbon footprint and rising fast. </p>\n<p>Use your artistic voice to contribute to climate change action and cool down the planet. We\u2019re going to make HD, 4K, and 5G look unnecessary, unsexy, and so last decade. Small file videos are intellectual, innovative, attractive, creative, and fun. We encourage you to explore experimental processes through low-energy technologies and deconstruct the fetishization of the pristine image. </p>\n<p>If we can get together physically, the Small File Media Festival will be held August 10-12 in the beautiful cinema at Simon Fraser University in glorious Vancouver, Canada, and streamed in curated programs of tiny files. Selected works will be screened live and receive a rental fee. We will be featuring an \u201cobsolete\u201d media viewing platform for submissions with alternative technologies, and an anti-facial-recognition fashion show and workshops alongside the festival. Additionally, all accepted works will have the option of being curated and streamed online through energy conscious means. </p>\n<p>If we can\u2019t get together physically, we\u2019ll festively stream curated programs of tiny files. </p>\n<p>Come join us and celebrate the beauty of the small file! </p>\n<p>File size restricted to 5 megabytes of fun!<br>\nSize to aim for: 1 megabyte per minute <br>\nLength: 1-5 minutes<br>\nMust record/submit processing/encoding time </p>\n<p>Looping media welcomed </p>\n<p>Categories: </p>\n<p>Aesthetic Invention<br>\nSupersmall files (how low can you go!) <br>\nNarrative<br>\nDocumentary<br>\nPorn*<br>\nSports<br>\nCat videos<br>\nAnimation<br>\nGIFs<br>\n\u2018Obsolete\u2019 technologies<br>\nPre and post-apocalyptic media</p>\n</blockquote>",
