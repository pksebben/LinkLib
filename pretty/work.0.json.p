I doubt I'll return to my current job after the leave, but no need to quit upfront if I can start off by taking some leave.</p>\n<p>My concern is about the timing of my announcement. On January 4, 2019 I complete my 3rd year at my current job. At that time, my employer's contributions to my 401(k) become 100% vested, so I would like my leave to start after that date to ensure I get that benefit. (It would be quite sad if I lost 20% of my employer's contributions because I left a few days before the maturity date!)</p>\n<p>Do I just give the standard 2 week notice? i.e. Announce my leave 2 weeks before January 4? I was thinking about raising it next week, several weeks in advance of January 4, but my concern is about management potentially pushing me out before my 401(k) benefits are fully vested.</p>\n<p>I have a neutral relationship with management so I would be surprised if they actually did something like that, but I have heard from other folks about some of the nastiness they are capable of, so I want to protect myself nonetheless. At the same time, I want my co-workers to have more notice so they don't need to scramble as much to cover for my absence.</p>\n<p>Has anyone been in a similar situation? What would you advise?</p>",

But I have had a very similar situation in the past with a neutral employer, who ended up playing hardball. I'd recommend if possible to just ride it out until the actual vest date, the moment you send an email stating your intention to leave, that counts as your \"notice\" and your employer is not obliged to be charitable after that. What did you end up doing?</p>",
