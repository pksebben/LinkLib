I think it's a lovely way to do connect and motivate yourself while working from home \u2013 would love to see more of you there! It's basically a shared 32-minute timer, and you can chat about what you're working on in the breaks! :)</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"100515\">Moritz Neeb (he) (SP1'17)</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/18928-announce/topic/shared.20pomodoro.20chatroom/near/108017631\" title=\"#narrow/stream/18928-announce/topic/shared.20pomodoro.20chatroom/near/108017631\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Inspired by <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"100514\">Anja Boskovic (SP1'17)</span>'s <a href=\"#narrow/near/108016900/stream/checkins/topic/Anja.20Boskovic\" title=\"#narrow/near/108016900/stream/checkins/topic/Anja.20Boskovic\">checkout</a> I created a room for shared pomodoros <a href=\"https://complice.co/room/recurse\" title=\"https://complice.co/room/recurse\">here</a>.<br>\nYou can join as a guest, complice might nudge you a little bit to join. Thus in the longterm RC should really have a clone of this as a place to \"gather\".</p>\n<p>I have set the settings to 32/8 minutes instead of 25/5 because it works better for me.</p>\n</blockquote>",
