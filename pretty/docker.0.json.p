IIRC I couldn't get either the dataset generator to work or the actual databases setup. I think it required installing HDFS and I kept getting a ton of convoluted error messages. As for the actual databases, I don't remember exactly what happened, but I tried setting up Virtuoso and IIRC it installs a bunch of different executables and you have to run them in weird ways. I would much rather just have a Docker container and run <code>docker run ...</code> to run the experiment.</p>",

As an example, when doing Postgres benchmarks, you need to run <code>ANALYZE</code> before you run your queries. Additionally, unless you configure Postgres not to, if you are seeing how good the planner is at estimating the cost of a query and are testing queries with lots of joins, Postgres will use an approximate planner (using genetic algorithms) instead of the traditional Postgres planner (which tries every possible query plan).

What I mean by this is that I think that the main difficulties with reproducible builds are solved by things that are tangential to what I see as the main point of Docker - I think that the difficulty with reproducible builds is mostly on making sure that the tooling and library versions are correct, and then on ensuring that the inputs are strictly controlled. Docker does do this, but it seems to me like that's mostly a hack to get around build systems being bad, rather than a good way of providing reproducible builds as a package author.</p>\n<p>If you look at tools like Bazel, they use some of the same kernel namespace/cgroup support that Docker does, but ~95% of the work that's done can be done without using kernel namespaces (as in, if you literally don't have the support for it in your kernel, it will still work) - it's entirely possible to get the exact same bytes as output for the same input without something as heavy as Docker. Rust is another example of doing this right - you very rarely see rust projects in docker containers, because cargo provides package version locking, and rustup allows you to easily install the correct version of the compiler toolchain (this will also likely improve once they stop breaking everything every nightly). </p>\n<p>I understand that there are some cases where it makes sense to use Docker (like the paper you linked), but to me it seems to me that in those cases, the question should be \"how are our tools failing such that we have to control the entire userspace environment to allow it to work reliably?\"</p>\n<p>Probably I should care less about this than I do - I see why it makes sense for people to use Docker to provide reproducibility and just not worry about it. It just makes me sad that the solution to tools being bad is to wash your hands of the whole thing and download hundreds of megs of userspace every time you want to run something.</p>",

It is really trivial to make a Docker instance that includes all packages a build will use and to test that building succeeds without internet access or access to files outside the docker image.
