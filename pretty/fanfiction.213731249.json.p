The sun tells them: You are three moons that are brothers, and until the day you die, you will spin in the air, to make the land bright when I, the Sun, am asleep, and so it will be. Your three lights will equal my own, but as you fade, one by one, the night shall become dim. When only one of you remains, you will know grief, and the night will be dark under you. This shall be. I am the Sun.</p>",
