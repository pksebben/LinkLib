I think most people in the department - myself included - had a \"wtf?\" reaction to the change. In the end, it worked out because I was a better email multiplexer, meeting attendee, face for the (internal and external) customers, churn resistor, and shit umbrella than any of the original engineers on the team.

Not that I think it's the same situation at all, but one of my biggest problems was even just figuring out the empirical limitations to what I can know about the project I am ostensibly responsible for.</p>\n<p>So, like, things got done more or less because I happened to know the most about what we were doing and the way forward was clear. But as the scope grew it became impossible to keep up, and I had to learn to delegate responsibilities, decisions, and even the work of ensuring quality to other people, and that has been way stressful. To be in a position where you are not even personally able to validate the quality of code line by line that you are responsible for leading? Way, way stressful.</p>\n<p>One of the surprising things that I found is that my emotional response to what is happening on a team is actually not at all related to the actual health of the project. A good example of this is conflict. I eventually ran a vaguely scientific experiment on our division's \"hack week\" and found that groups where everyone agreed about everything had substantially \"worse\" results than those with significant disagreements. So the collaborations I felt the worst experiences ended up with the best results! I realized I often couldn't trust my intuition for what a good result was.</p>",

One of the people who is on the team that I dotted-line tech lead for is one of the original members of the CLR team (i.e., has 20 years more experience than I do), and my former manager. At one point he confessed to me that he felt like he was always having to explain himself to the young people on the team, and that they wouldn't always listen or give his perspective the respect it deserved. To mediate this I basically validated his concerns, told him that actually we had some reasons to believe this conflict was really good for the group, I cited the work we did, and that was ultimately a pretty compelling case. From this I learned that if you can get people to a position where they WANT to work out conflict, then that is about 80% of the battle. We still made a plan to address his concerns, but it was a pretty illuminating outcome to me.</p>",

Internally we conduct a lot of studies on the effectiveness of our employees, and we do it pretty often, and one of the things that I've found really interesting is that we have a bunch of internal studies that show that our employees nearly always get better results when the people in there tends to be disagreement in the group about things. This is consistent across groups we set up for experiments and study, and across groups we observe in practice.</p>",

Similarly. coordinative communication takes a bunch of time <a href=\"https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1177349.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1177349.html\">https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1177349.html</a> . Therefore, do as much as you can asynchronously before and after the meeting, and have as few synchronous meetings as possible</li>\n<li>facilitator, gatekeeper, timekeeper, and note-taker are all roles that need to happen in a good meeting <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/2013/10/02/running-your-unconference-discussions-effectively-adacamp-session-role-cards/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://adainitiative.org/2013/10/02/running-your-unconference-discussions-effectively-adacamp-session-role-cards/\">https://adainitiative.org/2013/10/02/running-your-unconference-discussions-effectively-adacamp-session-role-cards/</a> . Meeting-runner's job is generally all of these, concentrating on getting questions answered that are stopping people from doing their work or that might cause future snags.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Project management in meetings. Ahead of time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>prep the agenda a lot ahead of time, including sharing it with others on a collaborative editing platform, and use that as the note-taking environment as well</li>\n<li>structure agenda so you know the \"shape\" (data structure) of outcome you want for every chunk of the meeting - \"yes\" \"December\" \"Michael\"</li>\n<li>Check the time allotted and make sure we'll have time for the last chunk of meeting</li>\n<li>Give people a calendar invite that has the mini agenda. The expanded agenda has <em>questions</em> and covers every section the mini agenda had.</li>\n<li>make sure the right people are there and excess people are not, especially excess people who often derail or go depth-first</li>\n<li>check previous minutes for undone TODOs or open questions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In meeting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure to catch open loops -- \"oh we need to check on foo before we decide\" \"ok, what is our plan for coming back and deciding based on foo? a decision tree?\"</li>\n<li>notice when people are going depth-first</li>\n<li>catch TODOs and note them in some easy-to-grep-for notation so you can gather them in the summary later</li>\n<li>especially in a remote meeting, structure the sequence -- call on people, especially when doing roll calls or checking who thinks what about a question</li>\n<li>whenever possible, notice two-person collaborative <em>doing/planning</em> conversations that arise, and defer and track them. \"let's make a note that this conversation needs to continue! AFTER THE MEETING\"</li>\n<li>how flexible to be with the agenda? Read the room. If a key question is clearly present and needs addressing now because it's a dependency for other stuff or because people need to resolve it for emotional reasons, take the time to address that (but take a moment to check when people's hard stops are, see if the meeting can go 5-15 minutes over time if necessary).</li>\n<li>don't use the word \"deadline\" unless you have to; people get antsy</li>\n<li>don't ask questions to which the literal truth is apparent to everyone, e.g., \"is it possible to do x?\" when we all know it's technically possible. Instead ask questions like \"Who has the power to do x and is there a blocker to them doing it?\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After meeting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>blank the Etherpad and move the minutes to an archive ASAP, and say on the Etherpad where the notes have moved to (single source of truth! perma-URL!)</li>\n<li>polish minutes and send it out, preferably with the summary + TODOs in a section at the top, ASAP</li>\n<li>do all your \"update such-and-such issue/wiki page/knowledge pool\" TODOs ASAP</li>\n</ul>",

(I would not agree to a regular meeting which has no particular end time, for instance.) So every time I notice a derail or people going depth-first, I interrupt and break in and say \"in the interest of time, [crisp suggestion for how to defer this in a trackable way]\" -- and then it's crucial that such deferrals <em>really get followed up on</em>, so people can trust it. Or I do the work ahead of the meeting to become a historian of the never-resolved thing from the past, so I can in the meeting give the sixty-second history and say, \"Therefore, we can do x or y, and I would like to nominate [person] as the champion whose job it is to get that decision made and publicized by [date]\" -- and then the outcome of the meeting is that you've successfully delegated it and taken the question out of this swamp.</p>\n<p>A few questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a person in the meeting who can just 100% concentrate on <em>running the meeting</em> rather than <em>substantively participating in the meeting</em>? I'm experienced and skilled enough that I can both run and participate in a meeting, with the exception that while I'm talking it's nice if someone else takes notes. But a lot of people cannot.</li>\n<li>Is there any chance people could do the Gather Agenda step ahead of time, semisynchronously, e.g., on chat?</li>\n<li>Are you open to a different template/structure?</li>\n</ul>",

The team definitely doesn't have the skills to do so organically, and I don't think he knows how to get there. He's also hampered by the composition of the team - it just takes one person to tie a consensus-based approach in knots.</p>\n<p>My science-PI insists on that model ... and he has some pretty serious issues with respecting other people's time, which has become all mixed up in the implementation  of the model for me. (Meetings start when he's ready, not when scheduled ... my favorite was a 3pm one on Father's Day Sunday that actually started at 6pm. I routinely had to walk out of meetings while he was talking in order to get to my other commitments.) I think that groups he's in wind up not being quite flat, while ones without him are better. </p>\n<p>And yet, I really like the benefits of it - in the ideal implementation, everybody is up to speed on team priorities, which means they're confident in judging what needs to be done. Team members' concerns have equal weight - and addressing when somebody \"emotionally needs to deal with this issue\" becomes explicit and valid. It takes additional meeting time (which FEELS like wasted time), but seems to reduce the doubling-back-to-readdress-issues and saves time in all the side channel discussions (rather than O(n^2), communications are O(n), with a rather high constant factor). </p>\n<p>It has a heck of a learning curve, and breaking people in is miserable. It took me years to get broken in and figure out how to work in that environment and appreciate the benefits of it - the first words that came to mind to describe myself were \"semi-reformed bulldozer\", but that's probably not quite fair to myself.  I see well-run meetings as helping to reign in people like me who are opinionated and loud, and enable everybody to have a voice, regardless of their preferred communication style. </p>\n<p>And yet, when I was a 2nd year grad student put in charge a group of collaborators from a much more authoritarian culture and needed to include them to the greatest extent possible in the running of the project ...  that model saved me. \"Dictatorial tendencies\" is another maybe-not-quite-fair phrase that comes to mind, and was a weird fit with \"this professor's boss has told him that I'M his boss for the next 2 months\". In that context, and in a quest for flat rather than top-down, I quickly learned that I had to speak last (or else nobody else would say anything), and to clearly separate discussion of the problem from the solutions (even when I thought I could see what needed to be done.) I'm perhaps a little too proud of how that team turned out - we had great people, and it was a joy to me to see other students go from timid &amp; apologetic about their skills to having fun, cracking jokes, making suggestions, and doing their jobs well (and being confident enough to laugh at their mistakes).</p>",

Becoming a Recurse Center hiring partner <a href=\"http://recurse.com/hire\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://recurse.com/hire\">http://recurse.com/hire</a> -- although the demographics aren't great for finding underindexed PoC <a href=\"https://www.recurse.com/hire#faq-recruiting-demographics\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.recurse.com/hire#faq-recruiting-demographics\">https://www.recurse.com/hire#faq-recruiting-demographics</a> .</p>\n<p>2. Here's the blog post my spouse wrote that helped him get a lot of nontraditional candidates at NYPL: <a href=\"http://www.crummy.com/2015/10/13/0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.crummy.com/2015/10/13/0\">http://www.crummy.com/2015/10/13/0</a><br>\nOne thing he did that really helped was specifically saying he was happy to have informational interviews with people who were thinking of<br>\napplying. I believe multiple info interviews he did led to successful candidates.</p>\n<p>3. What I would call \"the standard stuff\" -- find lists/groups/Meetups for \"[this group] in tech\"/ \"[this group] in CS at [university]\" and reach out to them.</p>\n<p>4. Consider reaching out to Dominic M. Liddell, founder, &lt;<a href=\"mailto:speak@dominicmliddell.com\" title=\"mailto:speak@dominicmliddell.com\">speak@dominicmliddell.com</a>&gt; of Tech While Black/Coding While Black &lt;<a href=\"http://codingwhileblack.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://codingwhileblack.com\">http://codingwhileblack.com</a>&gt;. I think I met him, like, once; this info may be obsolete.</p>\n<p>5. See if anyone you know is in PoC-in-tech Slacks and ask them to promote the opening.</p>",

These are good and useful ideas! But I noticed a part of myself holding back and feeling recalcitrant, and unearthed inchoate reactions that had words like \"cheesy\" in them. I am probably not alone in this, and I think it has a few sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a bias against learning and appreciating techniques that I saw in previous school/work environments where I was unsatisfied (even if the technique was only superficially connected to the sources of my dissatisfaction)</li>\n<li>a bias against learning and using and participating in any changes in how I currently habitually interact with other people, as a kind of pride in myself, and conflating awkwardness with authenticity and social skills with deceptive manipulation (there's a fear here of being exploited/objectified and of becoming an exploiter/objectifier)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I was wondering whether you could talk a little about any related pushback you've felt <em>within yourself</em> or among the people in your teams. I think the word \"cheesy\" in my reaction subsumes a lot of assumptions that get in the way of effective change, and I wonder whether you've run into anything similar?</p>\n<p>(For context, I've done some teaching and some management, but probably less people-report-to-me management than you have.)</p>",

            "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"2909\">@Sumana Harihareswara (F2'14)</span> There are a lot of great questions here and I'm going to try to make sure that my response covers most of it <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f61b\" title=\"mischievous\">:mischievous:</span> </p>\n<p>First I would say that letting engineers learn by getting burned requires you to have organizational and leadership buy-in. I have a huge advantage in that I generally work for organizations that are not in the \"tech sector\" (the US Government, the UN, various NGOs, etc) so I do not have to deal with a culture that worships at the altar of the \"asshole genius\". When people promote this idea that engineers by default have poor social skills it excuses behavior that creates real problems. If this is going on it's incredibly difficult to teach through failure, because people more senior than you will probably undermine the effort. </p>\n<p>So more than being brave or ruthless, it's about managing up. I talk to my stakeholders and make sure we're all on the same page as far as the way people should behave. I need their support, but their feedback is also super useful for me personally. I can be a bit neurotic and sometimes I think something is going to be an issue when it totally won't. My stakeholders provide an excellent sanity check.</p>\n<p>I find I can side step the \"cheesy\" factor by framing the issue with the engineers in question as an experiment. I'll use a normal feedback session to explain my hypothesis: I think if we did this it would result in the following improvements. I think if we failed to do this we would see the following consequences. And I just see how they react to that. If they agree, they usually adjust their behavior accordingly without me having to ask them. If they disagree we'll discuss the issue casually-- I want to hear and understand their perspective and make sure they feel heard and understood-- then I'll just leave the issue for a while. If their behavior doesn't trigger any negative consequences, great! I always want to have less process and more room for different styles and personalities. If there is a backlash we come back to it in another one-on-one and talk it through again. This is the point where I try to convince them to give my advice a try but if they have their own ideas I want to stay open to that too. I always try to frame it as a optimization problem. It's not about some deficiency in them. They are not getting the results they want. How do we tweak the configuration?</p>\n<p>It should go without saying but I will state for the record anyway: there are some problems that are too serious for this approach (ie sexual harassment)</p>\n<p>Again my particular situation has two big advantages that help this work: the first is that I've scored a lot of major wins for USDS largely by taking my own advice. When people are assigned to my team they have heard stories about my mystical powers and actually WANT to know what the secrets are (even if they start off planning to debunk them). A lot of times the conversation with engineers actually begins with them complaining \"It's not fair, how come when I do this I get this result but when you do the same exact thing everything turns out different?\"</p>\n<p>And then I point out the differences in our behavior and approach they're not seeing. I would say most of the time people are skeptical but curious enough to test it out for themselves, and then we go from there.</p>\n<p>The second big advantage is that what I do is not generally described as management internally. It's hard to sell the value of management skills in environments where people are dismissive of the value of managers in the first place. Most tech companies (including USDS) have this idea that you don't really need people to manage your people because everyone is smart and rational so obviously facts and data and good intentions will ensure we're all okay (ha!). I operate in an environment where bureaucracy is an unescapable reality, so people do not think of what I'm doing as management, they think of it as bureaucracy hacking. Nothing about the job changes, I just get to escape the stigma. That's why when I talk about the fellowship program we're starting I avoid the words \"management training\" or \"leadership development\" and go for language that emphasizes building high functioning teams. Everyone wants to build a dream team.</p>\n<p>When it comes to myself... I mean, I use the same approach haha which means I get burned sometimes too. I remember when I started teaching I was super dismissive of lesson plans. I had to get up in front of a class a few times because I fully appreciated that a lesson plan meant I can design escape routes in advance. Is the lesson going faster than I expected? Here's a place I can slip in some extra exercises to eat up time. Did something go wrong? Here's a natural place to regroup and refocus the room.</p>\n<p>I think the last time it happened was over project goals. I was reporting up to another manager  who had a very strict way of defining our scope of work. Like a data center could be smoldering in a crater and if it didn't advance our goals we were supposed to ignore it. I pushed back against that A LOT but eventually came to enjoy it because the manager was firm but also consistent and fair. So if you thought we should invest time and energy in doing something you had to argue that it served that goal. It meant we ignored some problems that we could have done some good on but it cleared up a shit ton of internal politics, which was ultimately more valuable. You didn't have some people getting more resources for what they thought was important because they were friendly with the boss. We were able to reach consensus faster as a team and people felt empowered to make decisions on their own because everyone understood the criteria.</p>\n<p>I mean the manager in question was former Silicon Graphics and early stage Amazon, I suppose I should have realized she knew what she was doing without having it proven to me but <img alt=\":shruggies:\" class=\"emoji\" src=\"https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13/emoji/images/1179.png\" title=\"shruggies\"></p>",

            "content": "<p>I wondered how to do planning, communication with management and form some more internal commitment.<br>\nOne of those big questions. Don't know if I can boil it down. Let's suppose there's a company like the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it's a small-ish company (CEO and two founders are the management, &gt;20ppl in the \"productive\" team: ~2/3 developers, 1/3 consultants)</li>\n<li>there a software and licences get sold b2b. but mostly on projects, it's often needs consulting that the software makes sense. there are a lot of projects in several stages (presales, poc, deployment, maintenance).</li>\n<li>the company is &gt;20 years old. there's quite some technical and organizational debt.</li>\n<li>company is growing a bit and struggling with it. many of the coworkers have been there for quite a while, let's say: max 20, median 10 years 0 years.</li>\n<li>the company was \"agile\" since almost the beginning but not fully&amp;evangelist. and this agileness went backwards a bit. the investors want to see profit now, the CEO was implemented ~ two years ago, pace changed, numbers count.</li>\n<li>some of the work times are tracked, but not all of it. the most wholesome data exists for those projects that need billable times, the others are 50% tracked.</li>\n<li>There are 7ish \"project leaders\" with each having on avg 5 projects in different stages. Some projects are somewhere else, without a lead, because it's just maintenance or because it's a research project or an internal project. Some of them are with partner companies, there's no real common ground. There's a monthly planning meeting where it's <em>tried</em> to allocate people to projects. Also there's some kind of performance analysis.</li>\n<li>the projects require different kind of knowledge not at all evenly distributed</li>\n<li>there's a daily standup of the whole team. it feels unproductive but also important for communication.</li>\n<li>there are a bunch of tools, gitlab, jenkins, a self-made planning tool, a tool for organizing docker instances, a fileserver with a <em>lot</em> of documents, a blog for technical documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's my questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how to allocate and plan a lot of projects in a team?</li>\n<li>is that company doomed?</li>\n<li>how to deal with the technical debt?</li>\n<li>how to deal with the culture change, new people coming in?</li>\n<li>\n<p>how to solve problems without introducing a bunch of tools? (feature/tooling creep?)<br>\n    * e.g. i've been looking at introducing zulip (currently there's no team chat), or something for decision making (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.loomio.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.loomio.org/\">https://www.loomio.org/</a>) or a wiki software for more internal documentation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>how to implement best practices if there is a \"everyone does what they want\" culture</p>\n</li>\n<li>probably a consultant?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>these are not very specific questions, I'm sorry. I'm not looking for specific advice. just ideas, things that came to your mind that were similar to the chaos above? maybe my question is \"how to culture change\", I adapted the title. but it feels stupid because how should someone new in the company even do something about that.</p>\n<p>maybe my question should be: how to cope with a situation like that as a newbie? what can I do, what can't I do? should I just concentrate on my craft and learn a lot of details about the software to make that one better? or should I try to learn a lot about management and planning and team needs because I think that's what the company needs?</p>",

The first step I would say is accepting that you might not be able to fix things at all. Sometimes your hands are just tied.</p>\n<p>The thing that stands out to me the most about your list is the number of projects. It seems like a lot. And it's probably pulling the organization in too many different directions at once. If you feel so empowered, I would minimize the number of active projects to start. That in itself is likely to kick off a high amount of drama.</p>",

I admit one of the things we're struggling with now as an org is people announcing changes as \"just an experiment\" without clearly communicating either their goals or the theory behind why THIS change. Then we never get to hear the results of the experiment. It either never ends, or it dies without a single attempt to iterate.</p>\n<p>It's so frustrating. I keep try to explain don't call things an experiment if you're not going to run them like experiments. What people hear when you do that is \"I don't give a shit about your opinion because I'm hiding behind the experiment label to discourage you from speaking out.\"</p>",

He likes to make sure people rotate through the different tasks we work on so that everyone is a generalist. Specifically, he tries to make sure everyone has to try something new periodically and also that everyone gets to be more of an expert than someone else at something periodically. He does this in order to foster a collegiate sort of environment, more psychological safety, and to discourage formation of expert/newbie castes. This description reminded me of what it was like to be at RC.</p>\n<p>What have you done or seen done to shape a team?</p>",

I've heard a couple of concerns from developers: (1) they would like clearer career growth options (how do I move up?), and (2) there aren't very many women or minorities in engineering in general, and particularly at more senior levels. We've also had a lot of talk from management about how the company cares about diversity and inclusion and wants to find ways to improve.</p>\n<p>I asked the CTO what he thought of developing some sort of program that involved career growth mentorship for women, potentially combined with coaching on helping with this for managers. He was supportive of providing resources for it, and would like to learn more about what programs other tech companies had along these lines.</p>\n<p>So this is pretty open ended, but does anyone know of initiatives like this? I.e. companies that have support for career development (say, how to become a more senior engineer, or for those interested how to move into management tracks), which could include mentorship groups with people other than your manager, and/or initiatives that helped guide managers in how to help people grow? I'm interested in any such things - they don't have to be for women specifically.</p>",

This could be a manager you report to or someone else. Their job is to guide you towards the visible projects that help career growth. They put your name in the hat when it comes time to choose people for a project, and they nudge you forward for promotions. This is very different from \"mentorship\". I think Lara Hogan has a few talks on things like this.https://larahogan.me/</p>",

A couple of male coworkers have expressed interest in more support about career development, and I think something open to everyone would make more sense. Perhaps what the company is running up against is lack of stated criteria for advancing + lack of advice on how to, and then people from more traditionally represented groups end up having more opportunities because that's what happens when criteria are unstated? </p>\n<p>Can you tell me more about the mentorship/sponsorship program(s) that etsy had? I'm looking for info about what such programs look like, so I can suggest them to my company -- though not looking to exclude anyone from participating. (Or open to other ideas, like how to foster sponsorship, or some other approach.)</p>",

We are accumulating these numbers to create a statistics on which areas (internal projects, presales, suppport, ...) we spent time on.</p>\n<p>Something that gives me a headache is the following: should this data be public? we are rather non-hierarchical, so it's not really possible to say only \"the manager\" should see it. Currently all the data tracked in this tool is accessible by everyone, but there are, intentionally, no aggregations on the individual level. There is this unspoken fear that this would lead to finger pointing. OTOH we are now in a situation that we can not really trust the data: We never know whether the data is incomplete or whether it is complete but something went wrong (because of overhead or so).</p>\n<p>How is are the controlling processes working in your companies?

For three, we don\u2019t do daily stand ups, design sprints, development sprints, or anything remotely tied to a metaphor that includes being tired and worn out at the end. No backlogs, no Kanban, no velocity tracking, none of that.</p>\n<p>We have an entirely different approach.

            "content": "<p>Hey Everyone,<br>\nI have a predicament that has been challenging as I have  been interviewing (with gratefully one offer already received). </p>\n<p>I have an employee that is very unprofessional in terms of communication, responsiveness and ability to get work on a critical path done. Mind you, he is someone who has significantly more experience that me  (according to his resume). However through my time managing him and with our previous manager, he would often \"disappear\", give nebulous updates on a daily basis that he would finish his work today, or just miss critical meetings. I also feel with a strong suspicion that with remote work being enforced with COVID, that he doesn't actually \"show up\" to work. With this I tend to have no choice but to give his work to other staff.</p>\n<p>Now, naturally myself and HR have spoken to him several times about this and his motivation. He explained he has been dealing with a suicidal friend and unrelated, says he has lost significant motivation to work on the companies goals. We spoke about if being motivated to support his colleagues would be beneficial and how candidly co-workers have been spending extra time to cover for his absence.  Lastly we have spoken about the need to be in constant communication about his availability if his personal life is getting in the way. These meetings have concluded with several rounds of apologies and promises of doing better.</p>\n<p>Now today, he ghosted again. No notice that he wasn't coming in, despite a critical piece of development belonging to him for a Monday customer demo. It makes sense to me to rapidly escalate this. </p>\n<p>My question is if I should I fire this person,  considering I am very likely to give some form of notice  of my own in the very near future? I also worry the executives  having loss another employee are in damage control and would like to remediate. I have not yet made them aware of the situation</p>",

My main solution that's worked pretty well is introducing a modified version of how most standups work and tweaking it to serve engineers and encouraging feedback.</p>\n<p>This probably isn't a great forum for deep reflection, but it's great for things like \"don't forget to get buy in on this before you spend too much time on it\" etc. It's also critical for more analytics/discovery focused work where constant feedback is really important.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we have everyone join a google doc at the same time to write a.) what they're working on b.) challenges and decisions they're thinking through. Using a google doc instead of going through everything one by one gives the process a lot more concurrency, allowing people to have much deeper conversations where necessary. This regularly produces productive collaboration and I've found the rate of people rabbit holing and not getting feedback has dropped off dramatically.</p>\n<p>Bit controversial, but this also helps me scale as a manager and reduce my stress levels a lot\u2014there's one point in the day where I can remind people of important things and quickly check in on people's work to see if they need feedback. The alternative is constantly nudging people on slack and being very reactive.</p>",

I've used <a href=\"https://www.small-improvements.com/\">Small Improvements</a>, which is the fancy version of a meeting scroll in a Google Doc. Their <a href=\"https://www.small-improvements.com/features/1-1-meetings/\">1:1 tool</a> lets you have a single-thread conversation before/during/after a meeting, which can be used for following up on a topic/goal. But I don't think it adds that much value for goal tracking, especially as I'd rather my report add status to the agenda for our next 1:1 instead of annotating the last one.</p>\n<p>(What I do really like about SI is the nice formatting for your/their talking points, notifications on updates, performance reviews, and standardized handover of this info when managers change.)</p>",
