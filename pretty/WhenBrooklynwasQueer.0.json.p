            "content": "<p>I went here, there, and everywhere in constellations of loosely related ideas while writing about this. I tried to trim it down (lol) to what\u2019s actually relevant to the question you asked, but just to say, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"100514\">@Anja Boskovic (SP1'17)</span>, thanks for the opportunity to think more about it! I often feel kind of caught red-handed when someone asks to me to <em>say more about that</em> and I\u2019m like\u2026 do I have anything to say about that? Do I even stand by the thing I said in the first place? I say a lot of things and one of the ways I figure out what I think is true is by trying it out out loud, ideally in conversation with dynamic and trusted interlocutors. I hope that\u2019s what we can do here in this bookclub! So:</p>\n<p>One of the things I really like about Schulman\u2019s non-fiction (and I especially recommend Gentrification of the Mind and Ties That Bind: Familial Homophobia and Its Consequences) is that because she\u2019s neither a journalist (though she\u2019s written some journalism) nor an academic, she allows herself the freedom to suggest ideas and causal relationships that are suggestive but totally unverifiable. This is what I mean by \u2018evocative\u2019; it doesn\u2019t say \u2018this is true and here\u2019s the proof\u2019 but rather \u2018this thing feels true \u2014 what if it was?\u2019 and then follows the trail of that thought. </p>\n<p>Am I compelled by the causal link Schulman suggests between some kind of ineffable proto-trans gender problem Carson McCullers may or may not have had and her ability to inhabit the subjectivities of others in fiction? Not necessarily. It's highly speculative (obviously) and falls apart at the slightest pressure: what is the figurative place she couldn\u2019t \u2018stand\u2019 but other, formally recognized people presumably could? What does 'officially does not exist' mean in this context, in 1940, and do a real maybe trans white writer and a fictional marxist black doctor 'not exist' in the same way? </p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think Schulman is really trying to make a claim that stands up to scrutiny. I do find it evocative as a rejoinder to the question she poses earlier: \"Who does a white writer have to be in order to overcome the institutionalized ignorance in which we are shrouded?\" This is the heart of what\u2019s going on here IMHO. Though she frames it as specifically about a white writer (and as a white writer, interesting to me on that level), to me this is a question with profound political and ethical valences beyond the making of art. Who do we have to be \u2014 who do we have to become, what resources do we need, what kinds of relationships help or hinder us \u2014 to face truths that our circumstances conspire to hide from us?</p>\n<p>I find moving and important the question posed here about the relationship between experience/subjectivity and the relations we can create with others. NOT what qualities, beliefs, or experiences come pre-packaged with certain identities (a dead end, regressive, invariably weaponized) but what opportunities can certain experiences and subjectivities offer us to cultivate certain qualities in ourselves or change our beliefs about reality based on new information, information that we can\u2019t test because we are \u2018shrouded\u2019 as Schulman says \u2018in institutional ignorance' and can only internalize by trusting what other people say about their own realities?</p>\n<p>Of course, our experiences change us. But the mechanisms by which they do that, the way they interact with other experiences and with time, the ways change manifests in our lives, are wildly idiosyncratic, which is part of what makes the whole process a rich subject for (especially narrative) art. Naming an identity is a poor metonym for describing a set of experiences and naming an experience is a poor metonym for describing the changes it catalyzed, yet so much of the way we relate to each other is based on inferring vast amounts of information from a set of symbols - \u2018gay\u2019, \u2018trans\u2019, 'survivor', whatever - that are highly abstracted yet increasingly rigid. A person who \u201cdoesn\u2019t know who she is,\u201d as Schulman describes McCullers, could just as easily (probably more easily) struggle to form authentic connections with other people as develop a preternatural ability to understand them. So if it were true that \u201chaving an identity that history had not yet discovered\u201d granted Carson McCullers an ability to \u201cinhabit any kind of person,\u201d why did she turn out that way instead of miserable and misanthropic? Or why is it that (it sounds like) she was miserable and misanthropic in her life and generous and sensitive in her art? </p>\n<p>A final note \u2014 which is directly relevant to When Brooklyn Was Queer, though I didn\u2019t bring the book with me to reference and so I don\u2019t know where Hugh Ryan comes down on this \u2014 is that personally I feel a wide degree of latitude to assign gender and sexual identities to historical figures. Why? 1. Because unless we believe that being queer is inherently worse than being straight (and I don\u2019t!), then what\u2019s the harm? And 2. if the end result of a politic of \u2018never assume anything about anyone\u2019 is that we are robbed of each other, then what\u2019s the point? Also 3. it's gossip, an important technique of queer communication and community-making which is also fun.</p>",
