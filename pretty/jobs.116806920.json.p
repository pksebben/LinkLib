I mean, I guess they had the game itself, but they somehow lost the source material? I guess this can also happen outside of the game industry.

And usually big studios will try hard to keep at least large part of the codebase, with only a little time in the pre-prod/ramp-up prod of the next game to fix stuff. So they might somewhat end up with big legacy code bases and hard deadlines. I recently read on twitter that the Frostbite engine (which is now used across all EA) is something like 10MLOC....</p>",

You\u2019ll have to care more about IO/network throughput than using your CPU to the fullest, but I find that to be highly entertaining!

I've been advised to highlight teaching skills (organization, leadership, creativity) more explicitly, but I'm not entirely sure how to do that without name-dropping the skills. I don't want to write something like \"Managed a classroom of 20 students, demonstrating organization and focus\" since that's just poor writing. I'm not sure how to mention those skills more organically.</p>\n<p>I'm also not entirely sure which teaching experience to include. In addition to teaching in the classroom for a few months, I've:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>taught a tutorial for the SciPy 2017 Teen Track (kids ages 12-18, reviewed highly, designed my own curriculum, I have my Jupyter notebooks on GitHub)</li>\n<li>been TA for an introductory physics course (4 academic quarters, reviewed highly)</li>\n<li>been nature director for a day camp (2 summers, kids ages 4-16, designed my own curriculum)</li>\n<li>directed computer programming and physics summer camps (2 summers, kids ages 6-8 for the physics camp and 8-14 for the programming camp, designed my own curriculum)</li>\n<li>taught biology to a homeschooling co-op for a month (kids ages 8-12, designed my own curriculum)</li>\n<li>tutored and graded a variety of physics, computer science,  astronomy, and math classes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Teaching has highly influenced me professionally and personally, so it feels important to include it on my resume, but I can\u2019t fit everything. I don\u2019t know which of these positions, if any, will best communicate good things to a hiring manager :)</p>",

A few questions I have: <br>\n- feedback on the content?<br>\n- should I remove any of the shorter entries? should I add more detail to any of them?<br>\n- should I add a \"skills/languages\" section? It seems redundant, since Android pretty much means you know Java, git, xml, and anything is probably of irrelevant to the actual job, but I see it a lot and wonder if I should add it.<br>\n- feedback on the layout? is it too dense? should I spend time making it prettier?<br>\n- is there anything you think I should highlight that I'm missing but might have done?<br>\nTHANK YOU!!!! <a href=\"http://recurse.zulipchat.com/user_uploads/13/Hf_RzSh7Zo654EEgPUEFe1Dp/ResumeAmeliaOct17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ResumeAmeliaOct17.pdf\">ResumeAmeliaOct17.pdf</a></p>",

If you're relatively early in your career, I think it could be useful in communicating what you might have learned, even if it doesn't communicate credentials. Then again, David and I went to liberal arts schools for druggy screwups (no offense), so the message might be different if you were in a more technical program and didn't graduate (unless the reason is along the lines of \"left to found highly successful startup\")</p>",

It'll be done over Skype, and one of the things HR told me is: \"You will be asked to give a brief presentation as part of the interview process.  The presentation allows the panel to assess your ability to put across your views in a persuasive manner.  The title of the presentation is \u2018Please provide a brief overview of your involvement in a recent engineering project\u2019 and should last for no longer than 10 minutes.\" Sadly, I don't have any inside contacts, so I'm coming to y'all.<br>\nHow would you approach this? I'm particularly stumped by the directive to \"put across your views in a persuasive manner\". Are they wanting me to talk about team dynamics and how I interact with people?  Or does that just mean that they want to make sure I can stand up and talk coherently for 10 minutes?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I can't send them slides describing what I've done at either of my last two technical jobs. I can talk about my roles somewhat-concretely, but both companies are serious about NDAs. Thus, generating a good slide deck would be a problem... I'd be trying to scrape together images from press releases and figure out how to avoid going into details. </li>\n<li>I can talk freely about my academic work, but while I do program a fair bit, and have lots of field experience, my work would probably be categorized as glaciology, data processing, or engineering management.</li>\n<li>I don't have any significant side projects - grad school + side job keeps me busy.</li>\n</ul>",

Unfortunately, I didn't track this last time, but I suspect it's much higher because there was one single recruiter who scheduled something with me and then failed to call me somewhere between five and ten times (I didn't just ignore this because I got pretty far in the process and allegedly had an offer, although I couldn't get the recruiter to email me the info without doing a phone call first and the recruiter couldn't actually call at scheduled times for some reason). Even if you exclude that one super weird case, I think I had a roughly 10% rate of calls not happening.</p>\n<p>From talking to other who are interviewing, this seems pretty normal? IIRC, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"w.aptekar@gmail.com\" data-user-id=\"101330\">@Wesley Aptekar-Cassels (F2'17)</span> had multiple calls not happen during the same day in addition to at least one call that didn't happen on another day, which almost certainly puts him above a 10% miss rate.</p>\n<p>Is this normal or is it just that I hear about and remember the unusual cases?</p>",

Please reprimand me if not!</p>\n<p>A friend of a friend in the arts is looking for someone for a gig and I thought it might be right up the alley of someone from RC.  Long story short, it's focused on visualization of data from an experience of online stalking. Description below: </p>\n<p>\"I'm looking for someone to create custom software for two pieces for a show that opens May 11 in New Haven, CT as well as help me with general and technical installation on-site (that is, in New Haven).</p>\n<p>The first piece involves natural language processing and data visualization. Inspired by experiences being harassed online, the piece analyzes the frequency and sentiment of different words in an archive of nonconsensual email communication. The program would use the Google Cloud Natural Language API to analyze the text of the emails as they come in, and this analysis would power a \u201clive\u201d data visualization (which would incorporate movement based on the the facial action coding system taxonomy of micro-expressions) displayed across several monitors in the gallery space. </p>\n<p>The second work is a bit simpler, and involves creating a program that can speed or slow the playback of digital footage.  The idea for this is to create a program that adjusts can adjust the footage being screened to the length of exhibition so that it never loops.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a $1000 stipend available through the gallery for the programming, though I might be able to get a little bit more from them.\"</p>\n<p>Please ping me with a DM if you want a connect.</p>",

Interns are paid a stipend of $5,500 and a travel stipend of $500.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.outreachy.org\">Outreachy</a> internships are open internationally to women (cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people. Internships are also open to residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, Native American/American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. We are planning to expand the program to more participants from underrepresented backgrounds in the future.</p>\n<p>The timeline for this round is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feb. 12, 2018 - Applicants start making contributions to internship projects</li>\n<li>March 22, 2018 - Application deadline</li>\n<li>April 23, 2018 - Accepted interns announced</li>\n<li>May 14, 2018 to Aug. 14, 2018  - Internships period</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Outreachy internship application process is different than traditional internship programs. Instead of submitting a resume, applicants complete an <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org/apply/eligibility/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.outreachy.org/apply/eligibility/\">eligibility form</a>, pick 1 or 2 projects from our <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection\">projects list</a>, and then start working with mentors to make a contribution to that open source project. Only applicants who have made a contribution and recorded it on the Outreachy website will be eligible to be selected as an intern. Once one contribution is recorded, applicants can start to work on the final application for the internship project.</p>\n<p>Outreachy organizers will have an #OutreachyChat Twitter chat on February Monday, February 26 at 4pm UTC / 11am EDT / 8am PDT, to spotlight the communities that are participating. Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/outreachy\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://twitter.com/outreachy\">@outreachy</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about eligibility after you fill out your eligibility form, please contact <a href=\"mailto:organizers@outreachy.org\" title=\"mailto:organizers@outreachy.org\">organizers@outreachy.org</a>. If you can't get in contact with a mentor or you're having trouble choosing which project(s) to apply to, you can contact our mentors mailing list at <a href=\"mailto:mentors@lists.outreachy.org\" title=\"mailto:mentors@lists.outreachy.org\">mentors@lists.outreachy.org</a></p>\n<p>Good luck applying! If you have any questions, feel free to DM me, or send me an email through the organizers email address (which reaches all the <a href=\"https://outreachy.org/contact/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://outreachy.org/contact/\">Outreachy organizers</a>).</p>",

            "content": "<p>Perhaps un-derailing :) I'm <em>really</em> not a fan of algorithms interviews - I like take-home and pair-programming interviews much better, because they feel less like I need to prove myself as a programmer. (See the article <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"jrubinovitz@gmail.com\" data-user-id=\"101692\">@JB Rubinovitz (W2'18)</span> referenced). Whenever I feel the need to prove I'm smart enough to be in this field, panic ensues. Which means I've passed about 20% of the algorithms interviews I've had, but have ~90% success rate in non-algorithms or untimed take-home interviews. So take this with a grain of salt, but it sure seems to me like algorithms interviews are about some combination of 1) have you seen the algorithms before and 2) are you confident enough to pull the algorithms out of your head during a timed, high-pressure assessment.</p>\n<p>I do think it's possible to do algorithms interviews well. The other day I had an interview I really liked. The interviewer gave me a choice between problems of two difficulty levels, and assured me that my choice of problem and performance on that problem had no bearing on my ability to be a successful programmer. In some sense, that shouldn't have mattered at all, because doing badly in the interview would have caused me to fail the interview even if it didn't reflect my overall programming capabilities. But that reassurance alone made the interview feel less about proving myself as a programmer, and I relaxed a lot, and ended up solving both the easy problem and the hard problem in the allotted time for the interview. So maybe interviewer attitude plays a big role in this too? But I guess if interviewer attitude were scaleable, we would have far fewer problems with biased hiring in tech <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f937\" title=\"shrug\">:shrug:</span></p>",

Part of my particular challenge is that I have no formal computer science background, so even though I've been coding for five years, I've only learned these algorithms fairly recently. So it's a huge challenge to me when my overall coding ability is evaluated based on a topic I don't know very well, and then when compounded with the high-pressure in-person interview format I'm a mess.</p>",

Most of what I've been doing has been in fields that require much more experience than what I've been able to accomplish (You can see what I've been up to in my <a href=\"/user_uploads/13/Yt-_1DVdVS0is_sKx-q2E2bl/Krishnan-Sarkar-Resume.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Krishnan-Sarkar-Resume.pdf\">resume</a>). So far I've only landed a single interview. I've been thinking about changing up what I've been studying to something that has readily available entry level jobs, but I've been having trouble deciding what exactly that should be. I'd like to hopefully keep studying something at least somewhat close, but I'm thinking that may not be possible. Should I try searching around for internships (<em>can</em> I still get internships)? Should I do a bootcamp? I'm really at a loss. Any advice or suggestion would be greatly appreciated! Is anyone else having as much trouble landing a job as I am? This has to be common, right?</p>",

I don't think that anyone would be confused by that. Maybe just make sure to use appropriate title like \"participant\" or \"student\" (though some may be confused by student) and then clarify it further on the interview if it's still unclear. That's what I do. It's CV, so it's basically \"what you were doing with your life at different moments in time and how successful you were at that\". I also don't have \"Jobs\" section, everything goes straight into \"Experience\" <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" title=\"simple smile\">:simple_smile:</span></p>\n<p>I heard many people disagree and recommend placing it under \"education\" or in some other far corner. It makes sense if you have more exciting things to place up instead. I think anything works as long as your CV makes sense in general.</p>",

Here are some of my thoughts, but you definitely know more about the specific situation than me, so ymmv:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're worried about this assignment taking away from RC time, is there a possibility you could do it Fri-Sun? Or otherwise timebox it, and say \"I'll work on my RC projects 10am-2pm, and then transition to this\"?</li>\n<li>To me, the tradeoff in time would only be worth it if (a) you're kind of excited about this company, and (b) you're learning something from the assignment. If you wouldn't actually want to work there, and the assignment is a chore for you, don't do it.</li>\n<li>Its tough to be in a position where one company you're interviewing with is at a different part of the process from the others. If there's any way to get them to give you some more time (maybe even after the code test is submitted), you'll do better if you can compare offers with a couple different companies you're interviewing at, rather than getting one offer, and then not knowing what you might or might not get from companies you're just starting to talk to.</li>\n</ul>",

Inclusive (at minimum: not actively exclusive) job descriptions plus a work sample test with clear goals and relation to the work you want them to do. Standardized process and evaluation, which is always a work in progress when you're hiring your company's first few $ROLEs, but is nevertheless a worthy goal. When in doubt, copy someone else! Startups get used to inventing things from first principles, but hiring does not have to be one of those things.</p>\n<p>They don't mention it explicitly, but your process should err toward over-communicative: never let a candidate stew without a declared next step and a date by which to expect that response. Even if you have to change those dates, an unbounded corporate silence is worse. When you do change anything, remember to tell the candidate about it! Not to single out recruiters as a class, but they often seem to need...encouragement...in this direction.</p>\n<p>On the company side of things, support your interviewers: tell them what their role should be and what needs to be learned from the interview. PI talks about this under \"train your interviewers to interview\". Don't force people to drop their work unexpectedly to prepare for an interview or to rely entirely on their existing library of favorite questions (which may or may not be good indicators of anything). Don't make people guess at who a candidate is; you should give sufficient notice of interviews and create a cultural expectation that interviewers will <em>at least</em> read the resume. This sounds like an absurdly low bar, but it is not. I've been tapped to interview a senior specialist infosec candidate for a first-of-their-role hire with less than a day's notice because the candidate was friends with the CSO. Don't do things like that.</p>",

RC has done a great job with this with <a href=\"https://www.recurse.com/what-we-look-for\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.recurse.com/what-we-look-for\">what we look for in recursers</a>; I've found this to be a good mental framework or starting point. It's really easy for biases to creep into this process; having to justify your recommendation to hire or not hire against some agreed upon criteria makes things at least a bit fairer.</p>",

So I totally agree that rubrics are helpful, but I think coming up with a good one is much easier said than done; it's a little like how trying to explicitly write down rules to tell if a picture is of a cat or a dog is just a total mess, so you have to resort to a maybe-hard-to-interpret machine learning thing.</p>",

The compensation is good, the risk is low, but more importantly: it's a professional environment. There is a ton of built-up structure that's designed to help me do my job better. There are lots of people and teams, so I can work on a variety of problems. I can focus deeply on a problem for months, which would be silly at a startup. I deal with sooo much less sexism at work. (This will vary a lot by company, but having e.g. clear promotion criteria is a godsend.) I've been at this place for 2.5 years and am still quite happy. There are downsides too (politics! inertia! less exciting mission...) but for me it's well worth it.</p>\n<p>I am also the kind of programmer who enjoys dealing with sort-of- legacy systems.</p>\n<p>There were things I really liked about Startup (decisions get made quickly! chances to work on lots of things! caring about the mission!) but in the end we weren't really effective at Mission, and it was a lousy working environment with mediocre pay.

Do they want to grow it big and dominate the world? Get acquired? IPO? Run a lifestyle business? This will dictate everything about how the company works. Your goal is to pick a company where the founder\u2019s interests align with your own as much as possible.</p>\n<p>2) In that same vein, it is helpful to understand the management team\u2019s background and composition. Make sure that all relevant groups (engIneerIng, marketIng, etc.) are well-represented and do tje best you can to verIfy that they respect each other. See if you can discern which group(s) are the most powerful and why.</p>\n<p>3) In my experience, culture Is set at the top but trIckles down to the bottom. If I lIke what I see/hear from people at the lower levels, I don\u2019t worry too much about management\u2019s effect on culture, since whatever they\u2019re doing seems to be working.</p>\n<p>Anecdotally, startup pay does seem to be around 50-70% of bigco pay right now, at least in New York.</p>",

In retrospect, a good sign was that attrition was very low (like, 4%/yr). This seems like a pretty controversial opinion in tech, where I often hear directors and other higher-ups say that single digit attrition is bad, but IMO it seems like a generally good sign that people like it enough that they want to stay.</p>\n<p>Another thing that seems good in retrospect is that everyone I know there agrees that the involuntary attrition (roughly half the attrition, or 2%/yr) was \"correct\". I think this is pretty unusual and at most places I know of, I'd say that most people I know think that most firings are bad firings and that management isn't really capable of figuring out who should be fired.</p>\n<p>But I don't think that these things are necessary or sufficient. I wouldn't recommend this place, which I <em>loved</em>, to more than 10% or 20% of people I know because the culture is really unusual and you have to be somewhat unusual to have a good time there (in particular, you have to be able to do well without any help, because you're probably not going to get any help).</p>",

Every one of those companies went under without producing a working chip, so I guess that was the right move (whether it was for the right reasons I'll never know), but I don't think this is relevant to software companies, where you can easily get away with having a product that isn't technically great or even good as long as the \"product\" side is good enough.</p>",

I think it's often overlooked that most jobs at a BigCo are really jobs in a team in a group in a division in a BigCo, with varying degrees of autonomy between organizational levels.  I'm very conscious of this, having worked in technology teams within financial firms for many years.  I was never completely oblivious to the enclosing corporation, but it was out of focus the vast majority of the time, when the technological challenges and cultural norms of the team took precedence.  It would be silly to broadly endorse the bank I work at as a great place to be, but I can enthusiastically recommend particular groups as exciting, innovative - even, essentially, entrepreneurial.  (Mine in particular, fwiw.)<br>\nWhile the enclosing corporation could in principle swoop in at any moment and substitute awful mangers or cancel my project (the latter has happened to me actually), such risks are often larger at startups, where nimbleness can translate into sudden responses to market fluctuations and the whims of investors.  (At the same time, there are startups with great benefits and large corporations that suddenly slash them in a cost-cutting exercise.)<br>\nMy standard advice, irrespective of the overall size of the company, is to pay closest attention to the specific people you'll be working with.  (Which comports with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"4996\">@Katrina Ellison Geltman (W'14)</span> 's third point.)</p>\n<p>That said, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"4992\">@Chen Lin (W'14)</span> , if a company has an ethical mission you strongly support, that might outweigh most other considerations.</p>",

But the reality is that many data science positions don't really require that. (Dubiously, \"data science\" has the word \"science\" in it.) In the company I worked in, it was enough that one was familiar with off-the-shelf tools for building predictive models and had a rudimentary knowledge of how to access their performance (e.g., ROC); we gave a little \"homework\" assignment to access that. The company I worked at was not Google.</p>",

The problems are challenging, but I thought the interviewers were pretty pleasant and I found it to be one of the more pleasant processes compared to some other places.</p>\n<p>Back on topic, I totally agree with Dan that interview circumstances and interviewer quality can vary widely enough that rejections aren't in themselves particularly high signal. I also think that rejections at the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stage are especially useless for gauging these things -- different companies have different recruiting culture and attend to different things. (A company I worked at declined to pursue someone I referred because her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 didn't have sufficiently tech-startup-y companies in the experience section. She handily passed the first Big-N hiring process she tried and is doing quite well there instead.)</p>",

RC can help me get interviews but passing them is up to me. The only company I applied to through RC (Two Sigma), I got rejected after the third round. I'm just grinding LeetCode for now while trying to get referrals for easier companies (going for something around the level of difficulty of IBM). I could likely do better than IBM but I'd really like an easy company to fall back on in case I don't get any offers.</p>",

I still got rejected (including at the resume screening stage) at several companies. I eventually got 2 job offers (incl. one lowball) after applying to 8ish companies. There is a lot of variance in the process. It's frustrating all around.  I would nth the advice from others to leave aside the \"ranking\" of companies that you seem to be doing. There's too much variance for that to be a useful metric, and if you're interviewing at a company that you think you could \"do better than\" your interviewers might pick up on that attitude.</p>\n<p>Also, if you haven't already done mock interviews at RC, I would strongly recommend it. (Biased! I'm one of the mock interviewers.) We can give you feedback on both technical performance and also some of the less-quantifiable aspects that could be coming through in an interview. Many companies screen for more than just whiteboard algorithms skill.</p>\n<p>Good luck with your search.</p>",

Ideally you'd have a good range of difficulty, but don't worry too much about any individual job that you apply for being out of reach.</p>",

However, they will often have more specifics in mind: for instance, their team might have room for two \"software engineers\" with a few years of industry experience, but they may only be willing to hire one first-time \"software engineer\" per quarter (or whatever - scaled based on the size of their team and mentorship capacity). More than getting a referral, getting this kind of information can be useful if you have acquaintances who are familiar with those teams' hiring needs.</p>\n<p>So I'd say that places like Airbnb, Bloomberg, etc aren't out of your reach, but it depends on a lot of luck, and whether or not specific teams can accommodate someone at your skill level right now.</p>",

Their job is to determine if I am a person they want to work with. Self-selecting out on the worry of \"but maybe I'm not good enough\" is both career-limiting and taking away their agency; they know what skills they need better than I do, and if I think I might want to work there, it's in both of our best interests to apply! The worst they can do is say \"no.\"</p>\n<p>Some companies are famously selective, and some companies are lesser-known, but I want to be selective in my career choices, as well. Making a decision that will affect at least the next few years of my life is not to be taken lightly, and if I can afford to, I want to be very picky in what work I will apply for or accept.

I have been working in the electronic design automation industry building software for compiling and running hardware design languages. This is so very niche that the work doesn't resemble most other programming jobs out in the world today. I am afraid of turning into a dinosaur and going extinct! I want to understand what are the possible job descriptions I can apply to. I am fairly well-versed in C and C++, but I find that even C/C++ job postings mention terms way different from what I do. I am willing to move to a different programming language/environment. </p>\n<p>Can someone give me some suggestions about which direction to go, since there are way more varieties of programmers around? For example, I have dabbled with web programming languages from time to time - but what are the realistic chances of companies willing to hire me for something like a full-stack development role given that my resume shows more than a decade of C?</p>\n<p>Note: It is okay to give me long-term options as well, e.g., you can tell me \"you need to do this and this for such and such years on the side\".</p>",

Having worked remotely for non-programming jobs, I've grown quite partial to the lifestyle (no commute, flexible schedule, not having to pretend to be busy, etc.). It seems like companies are becoming more remote-friendly these days, but I'm concerned that it could mean less interesting work and less upward mobility as a consequence of lower rapport with my manager/coworkers.</p>\n<p>For context, I'm looking to enter my first programming job and don't think I would look for a remote position right away - I'd like one where I can receive a good amount of in-person mentoring. But would like to potentially move into a remote role later on and wanted to get a larger context for the implications of doing so.</p>",

There are copious resources on software engineer interviews, but I'm not finding much at all on developer advocate interviews (aside from Google's)</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any experience or advice on preparing for developer advocate interviews in general, and/or interviews at relatively early stage startups in particular?

What helped me tremendously was that I just had a few positive experiences with staying in private room listings where I got the chance to chat with some interesting hosts/fellow guests and even wrote a blog post about it <a href=\"http://digitalfreepen.com/2016/01/13/nomad-airbnb.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://digitalfreepen.com/2016/01/13/nomad-airbnb.html\">http://digitalfreepen.com/2016/01/13/nomad-airbnb.html</a>. The culture fit interview was basically me saying how I thought this was a cool way to connect people. These days well...Airbnb is a much bigger thing and hosts/guests skew more toward the 'I do this for side income/because it saves money' side than 'I do this to meet interesting people' so I don't know how much I still believe in that, but it's still part of the spirit of the company.</p>\n<p>The other thing I'll say is that internally, the culture of the company matches the business pretty well, which is \"be a host\". At a high level this means \"be welcoming and helpful\", and at a low level it means things like wash your own dishes. They push this pretty heavily and it was actually a bit too much for my tastes, but it's not necessarily a bad thing and lots of people like it.</p>",

But here are some possible changes to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To me, drop shadows feel pretty dated; I'd consider making the Adobe suite icons flat instead (also because the rest of your resume is flat)</li>\n<li>Your first bullet under experience has a slight misalignment. The bullet point is top-aligned for that one, and middle-aligned for the other points.</li>\n<li>I'd drop the \"Hello, I'm\" at the tippy top. I think it's slightly confusing because it's not something you usually see on a resume. It also adds an additional font type (a condensed version of the one you use throughout?) without a compelling reason for the additional complexity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And then some typos / writing stuff: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>This one is actually really important (or so I'm told); you shouldn't use \"I\" or any personal pronouns at all on a resume. I saw some statistic that said using personal pronouns dropped response rates by like 50% [citation needed, but I think this is pretty standard advice].</li>\n<li>Exercise, not excersize (under UR calculator)</li>\n<li>Under RC, I'd use learned instead of learnt if you're applying to any US jobs. Learnt is pretty much never used in the US &amp; it 'looks wrong' even though it's technically correct.</li>\n<li>Under UR CS, I'd put U. Roch. or something, it took me a minute to figure out what UR is. Also, peer mentor 'for' students; 'toward' is awkward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's all I can think of; it's very pretty!

Being direct is IMO the most likely strategy to get the recruiter to stop being pushy<br>\n2. There is literally no mechanism by which not disclosing expected salary will cause you to be dropped from the process</p>\n<p>The recruiter kept on asking me, though, at least once per phone call. I eventually asked \"Why do you want to know my expected salary?\". My recruiter's response to this was that they needed to know the expected salary to determine what level to interview for (which is also total BS). However, if you know the leveling system at Google, you can simply directly tell the recruiter what level you would like to interview for (if you do not know the system, I can explain it to you). YMMV wrt the recruiter's answer to that question, but for me it was a useful way to start the conversation about what level I was interviewing for while also getting the recruiter to stop asking me questions about salary. (another useful bit of info - you can explicitly tell your recruiter what level you want to be interviewed for, and AFAICT this usually works.)</p>\n<p>In general:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is almost never a good idea to disclose expected salary</li>\n<li>Recruiters actually have very little power in the process, especially if you know about Google's process</li>\n<li>Google has a very well defined pipeline that you will go through, and the recruiter will push you through this pipeline regardless of whether you have given expected salary or not, simply because the incentive structure is set up so that they get paid when people get pushed through the pipeline. If this is not happening, or you run into other problems, it is probably because the recruiter is just bad - if that happens, unfortunately the only way to really fix it is to talk to someone inside of google (which is really Not Ideal). Feel free to ping me if there are problems and I will see what I can do.</li>\n</ul>",

I am not sure what to do because if I decline them - I am taking a risk and I am afraid I might not get any more offers and regret it a lot because I will be left internship-less but at the same time something better may come along!  <br>\nThis my first time in the job market so I wanted to know more about others' experiences in this matter.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Yay people read things I write! My perspective, using this taxonomy, and given what I already know about you ( <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f61c\" title=\"stuck out tongue wink\">:stuck_out_tongue_wink:</span>) :</p>\n<p>If you want to pursue machine learning engineering, you already have a big leg up since you have a PhD in math, which is a strong accreditation. But to get your foot in the door, you would still need a lot of experience building and running <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f44c\" title=\"ok\">:ok:</span> models. In my not-really-unbiased opinion participating in Kaggle competitions is the best way to get that experience, and you need maybe 1000 hours of Kaggling to get the necessary experience. This is how many hours it took Yifan Xie, an EngD, to get good enough to start his consulting business: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ylpmjG6t8E\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ylpmjG6t8E\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ylpmjG6t8E</a>. Obviously this isn't something you can do in five weeks, more like two years. <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span> </p>\n<p>If you want to pursue data engineering, your background is less important. Honestly you get a data engineering job you \"just\" need to be good at coding challenges and system design interviews. Starting from scratch, the estimate I'd put for going from \"zero\" to \"SRE at Google\" is three to six months. I don't remember a name but I met a Recurser at an event in SF who transitioned off a number theory PhD to that within that time period.</p>\n<p>If you want to pursue data analytics. From our conversations I think you already have a pretty strong background. You're right that building a small but attractive portfolio would be the best strategy, and that seems like a reasonable estimate of how long it would take. Having a PhD in math helps a lot for hiring. I think you could pull it off in a couple of months.</p>\n<p>NB: all of these estimates are based on patterns I've seen in industry in the US. I don't know how well they carry over to Germany.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"5ylpmjG6t8E\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ylpmjG6t8E\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ylpmjG6t8E\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5ylpmjG6t8E/default.jpg\"></a></div>",

Like your article, it does a good job of clearly delineating the three strands of data science. Your timeline estimates help me get a better sense of whether my expectations might be unreasonable/na\u00efve ... Given my time constraints, getting into data analytics (though I have little interest in it) might indeed be a more pragmatic short-term strategy. Thanks for sharing your broader perspective.</p>",

If you fail the take-home, you will feel used.</p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>A recruiter from an SF-based company reached out to me about a data engineering position. The description sounded perfect so I applied. The first step was a take-home exercise that was supposed to take \"around 4 hours\". This is a red flag. <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f6a9\" title=\"triangular flag\">:triangular_flag:</span></p>\n<p>First, a \"4 hour\" exercise will likely translate to 6-8 hours of work. This is important to understand if you're applying to multiple places at once and have a limited time budget for these kinds of exercises.</p>\n<p>Second, and more importantly, if a company presents such a large obstacle to you right at the start of the interview process, my advice to you (and to my future self) is to just walk away. You don't know much about the company; you haven't met or spoken to any of the engineers; their engineers haven't met you. Investing 6-8 hours in an unpaid take-home exercise when you have so little context about the team is risky. What if your first conversation with an engineer nixes the whole opportunity for you?</p>\n<p>If you get rejected, like I did, you will feel used. I felt this all the more since the company did not provide any specifics about why my submission wasn't good enough, so I didn't learn anything from the experience. 6+ hours of work, 8+ hours if I include the initial calls and email exchanges with the recruiter, for nothing.</p>\n<p>In the future, I will ask to meet at least one engineer before agreeing to any lengthy take-home exercise. I will also ask about how specific the company is about take-home feedback. (I know it's difficult for anyone to give feedback when rejecting candidates, but it doesn't hurt to ask.) Some companies even pay candidates for completing their lengthy take-home exercises. Unfortunately, this practice isn't as widespread as it should be, so I wouldn't expect this.</p>\n<p>I hope you found this story useful, and that you don't make the same mistake I did.</p>",

It's like the entire industry-wide hiring process is built upon a foundation of zero tolerance for cheating with little consideration for whether it's actually screening for the right thing. I wonder if it's inherited from the academic testing that people went through in university. I'm also skeptical of how widespread cheating would be or that a lot of people would try to get a job they know they're not qualified for.

I've done a couple of those interviews with people who were not programmers. Maybe I've just been lucky,  but in 10+ years of interviewing, I've only seen a handful. Few enough that I wouldn't expect it to be a huge risk to bring someone in for an onsite based on code they claim is theirs but they didn't write it in front of me. Especially if it's clear to them that they'll be expected to modify that code at the onsite. This is still an untested hypothesis on my part so I understand your skepticism <span class=\"emoji emoji-263a\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

The freedom as a contractor is largely illusory, and the insurance situation is a comical nightmare. I happily rescheduled a dental appointment to February so my palate can bask in corporate largesse.  But the process is somehow nerve wracking. I spent two hours filling out a background check form on a site that kept crashing with 6 digit status codes unknown to the W3C, and then their agency wrote back to request detailed explanations of the circumstances of my departure from every previous job, including my present one, where the answer should have been obvious. I used to have lawyers review new employment contracts, but no employer ever agreed to the slightest modification, so I didn't bother this time. Admitting that it's a luxury to get to complain about such mild inconveniences, I still find my cynicism kicked up a notch. I work for the money and because the problems are fun, but I can't imagine ever again having abstract loyalty to my employer as an entity of particular character. <br>\nSorry for the rant. Obviously I can't  complain on social media, but I have a deep psychological need to complain to someone.</p>",

There are also institutional problems with it, in that you only get credit for the work you produce so there's not much incentive to do tasks that are helping the team as a whole.</p>\n<p>However. We're also super conservative about making changes to the code, because we have to have fairly high reliability (our reliability and cost-of-downtime are pitiful in all senses to internet-scale people, but for an academic robotics group, they're high). </p>\n<p>Just before I arrived, the group did a major migration of its codebase (mostly for the good!), but it has almost instantly ossified again because once it's \"proven\" on the robot we don't have an accepted way to qualify the code short of testing it on the robot ... and we get 1-2 test days A YEAR. So, the codebase is easier to work in than it used to be, but the culture still isn't. </p>\n<p>I'm hoping to push the team towards adopting code review and more robust simulation as ways to enable more agile development (word chosen intentionally -- somebody gave my boss a book on \"agile\" and he liked it but hasn't managed to practice it) and make it less scary to make changes to the code. </p>\n<p>So ... does anybody have good resources for this? Most of the team hasn't written software in industry, so they have no personal experience of how much these tools can help -- they just see the costs.  My boss is more likely to respond to an authoritative study or book than my arguments -- I haven't proven myself in this role, and in their eyes, I probably won't prove myself before I quit out of disgust.</p>",

I'd also recommend using an auto-formatter like <code>yapf</code> or <code>prettier</code> (maybe on a pre-commit hook) so that you don't waste time discussing the same style issues again and again. Agile development means different things to different people, and I'd avoid using the term at all. Instead, focus on the specific best practices you want to implement.</p>",

They came up with four primary benefits engineers get out of code reviews:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Education - Teaching people who are making the change about the area of code.</li>\n<li>Maintaining Norms - Making sure specific formatting or usage patterns are preserved.</li>\n<li>Gatekeepering - A person on team A shouldn't have free reign to make changes on Team B's code. Code review is a way you can help enforce design decisions and maintenance.</li>\n<li>Accident Prevention - Catching any bugs or mistakes before they go into production.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are mostly in line with what I see the benefits of code review are.</p>\n<p>If you want to try to get your team to do code reviews, the two things I would try to do are:</p>\n<p>1) See if you can get a small group of people to start doing code reviews as an \"experiment\". Once you demonstrate that code review is a beneficial practice within this group, you can make a case that more people should be doing code review.<br>\n2) Look through historical changes and come up with data points for how code review would have been beneficial. \"This change here didn't follow standard practices.\", \"This code uses a naming scheme that's hard to follow\", etc.</p>",

You're asking for references to authorities on code review to help get the team more on board with the practice, but it seems like there are a lot of other things to fix on the team that may have better leverage towards improving things in the long run.  In a lot of ways it seems like the process is bankrupt in terms of time and effort with such a long iteration cycle, and such a distant checkpoint for gathering concrete feedback of the codebase.</p>\n<p>I have no ideas for how to fix the sparse feedback loop on correctness of your software, but I think if you were to come up with a way to fix that problem, so many other things would open up.   You need a feedback loop in order to adopt agile practices, so your idea to implement more robust simulation sounds like a good path.  Once you can remove the year-long iteration cycles it will open a lot of opportunities both for exploring the types of problems that are unknown in the space that the software has to operate, and for adopting better engineering practices like code review and others.</p>",

            "content": "<p>You might want to check out Cleanroom methodology. The basic idea is that you write a spec, review the spec with the team and then code review is the team checking your implementation vs. the spec. The studies show a significant decrease in bugs. However, the studies are from IBM and NASA I think so it might not help with the \"we don't have those kind of resources\" push back.  My takeaway from Cleanroom is that it helps to be clear about what you're checking for in the code review and limit it to stuff only humans can do. One other interesting note about Cleanroom that might apply to your team is I think the teams were able to reduce the number of bugs before they ever did any testing.</p>",

He argues that imagination fails in three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Imagination tends to add and remove details, but people do not realize that key details may be fabricated or missing from the imagined scenario.</li>\n<li>Imagined futures (and pasts) are more like the present than they actually will be (or were).</li>\n<li>Imagination fails to realize that things will feel different once they actually happen\u2014most notably, the psychological immune system will make bad things feel not so bad as they are imagined to feel.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All that said, good luck with the process, I hope you get the job! <span aria-label=\"four leaf clover\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f340\" role=\"img\" title=\"four leaf clover\">:four_leaf_clover:</span></p>",

My supervisor realizes that without a better solution than we have now this will probably result in each project forking the code to fix bugs / add features that are important to them and never coming back together, and is very interested in figuring out how to get a \"release\" process (his words) that works for everybody and keeps all projects on the same main branch. </li>\n<li>For one of the robots, full-system tests cost mid-five-figures a day, and due to ship schedules and budgets, we only get a few days a year. I think I've convinced my supervisor that we need to have more robust software unit tests / simulation / bench testing, but the question is what that looks like.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, does anybody have suggested references?

I also agree with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"7625\">@Cory Dominguez (SP1'15)</span> that it's helpful to do a bit of prep before 1:1s so you can get the status updates out of the way beforehand and have some specific discussion points to cover. We have a shared Google Sheet with sections like \"Wins for the week\", \"Primary Focus\", \"Action items for next 1-1\", \"Feedback\" and \"Personal Development.\" It seems to help to have some structure since it's pretty easy for both the manager and the IC to accidentally steer the conversation to \"easier\" topics like status updates.</p>",

            "content": "<p>I'm also at a startup now where the founder I report to is a first-time manager.</p>\n<p>It's a tough sitch because often, there's no one else holding founde accountable and coaching <em>them</em> on how to be a better manager. So it's actually up to you to set clear expectations for how you want your manager to grow. It can definitely feel awkward to reverse the direction of authority here, but keep in mind that if you don't hold this person accountable, no one else will. You could try to start a conversation with something like, \"I feel like I'm lacking some of the personal direction and coaching I need to continue growing. I have some suggestions for how to use our time together that would help me improve faster.\"</p>\n<p>An important part of these conversations is to learn as much as possible about your manager's job. Nick's suggestion, Radical Candor is a great book, altho it focuses on relationship management and feedback over other things a manager must do effectively, like setting expectations and empowering people. I'd also recommend Julie Zhou's <a href=\"https://juliezhuo.com/book/manager.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://juliezhuo.com/book/manager.html\">The Making of a Manager</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\">The Manager's Path</a>. If you have the impression that your manager is confused about what their job is, you could push for them to read these books (salty opinion: if you're going to be responsible for people, you should try to learn as much about doing that effectively as possible). You can also take pieces from these books and push your manager to adopt these behaviors.</p>\n<p>On a more tactical note, I'd emphasize what people are saying about setting crystal clear expectations for what your manager would like to see out of you. Online career ladders etc can be helpful here, but the expectations can be very different at a startup, especially if engineers are also wearing product/business/ops hats. Ultimately, the question your manager needs to answer is what things would they like to entrust you with 6 months to a year from now that you might not be able to tackle today?</p>\n<p>But that's only half the equation. You and your manager also need to figure out what things you can do to get there. This might be outside resources, but most often, it comes in the shape of projects that push you out of your comfort zone. Can you push your manager to delegate things they/more senior folks are doing that will give you a chance to learn new skills?</p>",

            "content": "<p>Congrats on starting your first tech job! In my experience as a developer, onboarding is usually fairly informal unless the company is large or is hiring rapidly. I\u2019ve always been assigned an onboarding buddy whose job was to help me get my development environment set up, get access to the company\u2019s systems, etc. This person is an excellent first stop for questions as you\u2019re getting started. They should also introduce you to others, and as you figure out who knows what you can start to spread your questions around more. This is important because you will have a TON of questions and the person (or people) assigned to onboard you will have other assignments on their plate as well.</p>\n<p>It takes a long time to become fully onboarded - usually on the order of months, in extreme cases years - so the trick is figuring out how you can be helpful and add value in the meantime. In my onboarding experiences, I have usually gone through a down period a month or so in when I wasn\u2019t getting new hire attention anymore but still wasn\u2019t fully up to speed. It was hard because I felt like I was so slow and couldn\u2019t contribute effectively. Just know that this is normal!</p>\n<p>Onboarding is all about:</p>\n<p>1) Asking lots of questions, while respecting your coworkers\u2019 time</p>\n<p>2) Figuring our the company culture</p>\n<p>3) Keeping an open mind (the company isn\u2019t perfect, and you are going to see how the sausage is made - don\u2019t be too judgmental yet)</p>\n<p>4) Finding small, doable things to do that make your coworkers\u2019 lives better.</p>\n<p>Enjoy starting your new role and getting up to speed!</p>",

For example, remotees have their own Employee Experience person whose job is to make sure remotes have all the equipment they need, help sort out interjurisdictional employment issues, and schedule remotees-only events (I think one Halloween they did a pumpkin carving contest). Remotees have their own Slack channel just like each office does. Many teams are remotes-only or a mixture of remotes and in-office people; teams don\u2019t usually hire by saying \u201cwe need someone in Location X\u201d. This means that all teams adopt a remote-friendly communication style by default, and offices are designed to support this (i.e. video chat setups in every conference room).</p>\n<p>I think my main takeaway is that hiring remote employees at scale can be really effective, but it requires a lot of thought and effort. I can see why Stripe is taking steps to formalize this. I hope it goes well for them!</p>",

            "content": "<p>I can tell you how I approached onboarding people at Heap. I've onboarded a few engineers onto my team.</p>\n<p>The most important detail to keep in mind when onboarding someone is that you are making an investment. You're slowing down the work now, so that you can move faster later. It's completely worth it if, when you are onboarding someone, you ship nothing for three months, as long as the person you are onboarding is now fully ramped. That investment will break even after another three months and then start producing ROI after that. When onboarding someone it's good to keep track of whether or not the person is net-positive yet and how long it's going to take them to get there.</p>\n<p>As for actually onboarding a person, here's how I go about approaching it.</p>\n<p>1. Have a conversation with them where you discuss what interests them and the kinds of things they want to learn. I'll keep track of this and use it to inform the kinds of projects I give this person and what areas I train them in. This isn't useful just for onboarding, but also throughout the entire time you work with the person.<br>\n2. There are a number of processes a person needs to be familiar with before they can do anything. This includes things like setting up a development environment, making a PR, etc. Sit with them and walk them through how to setup these things.<br>\n3. Have them make a trivial change to the codebase. This can be as simple as adding a comment to the source code or changing some variable names. Walk them through the end to end process of making the change, committing their code, and requesting code review.<br>\n4. Give them a self-contained starter task. The goal of this is to get them familiar with some part of the code they will be working in. This can be something like, we want to setup an alert when a DB query runs for more than five minutes. They'll have to learn how to make DB calls to detect when a query has been running for more than five minutes and how to trigger alert.<br>\n5. <em>Very Important</em>. As they work on the starter task, check in with them every 30-60 minutes. Very often people will get stuck and not tell anyone. Often you'll be able to get them unstuck in a matter of seconds. When you check in don't just ask them are you stuck. You should ask them what they are currently working and what's left for them to finish. Make sure they are making forward progress. You should adjust the frequency of how often you check in with them based on how often they get stuck. This will feel like you are micromanaging them. In practice, this is the best way to make sure someone doesn't get stuck as they are onboarding.<br>\n6. Once they complete the starter task, give them another task with slightly larger scope. Keep giving them tasks until they understand a good portion of the code they will be working on. Usually you want to give 3-4 starter tasks where the first one can be completed in a day and the last one takes 2-4 weeks.<br>\n7. In meetings, have them right down all the terms they don't understand and questions they have. After the meeting is over, explain to them what all the terms mean and answer all their questions. This is a way to help them understand things without needing to disrupt meetings.</p>",

They're seeking women in STEM fields to talk about their experiences negotiating (...presumably salary-wise?). Details below!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>STEM Women Negotiating: Recruitment Letter for Study Participants</strong></p>\n<p>The researcher is conducting a study to understand the experiences of women in the STEM professions when they negotiate. Negotiation is an important skill and necessary for performing well in the workplace. As part of this study, the researcher is conducting 60-90-minute individual interviews of women who are in one of the STEM professions (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and have</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less than 5 years work experience;</li>\n<li>Between 10-15 years work experience;</li>\n<li>More than 25 years organizational work experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It does not need to be the same organization for that duration of time, but collectively.</p>\n<p>The researcher is from Columbia University and teaches negotiation in a masters level program and externally in organizational contexts. Each interview will take about 60-90 minutes, done over Zoom. The participants will be asked some questions related to negotiation and will be asked to use some communication models as part of the interview. The results will be anonymous and no information identifying the participants directly to the results will be made.</p>\n<p>As a follow-up to the interview, the researcher may request another brief conversation to ensure the information captured is represented accurately. In turn, the participant may also request a follow-up conversation in case there is something else she thought of and wanted to include or if she wanted to further clarify points made. An informed consent form waiver will be given and you will be asked to verbally agree to participate in this study.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in participating in this study or referring participants, please contact <strong>Beth Fisher-Yoshida at <a href=\"mailto:bf2017@columbia.edu\" title=\"mailto:bf2017@columbia.edu\">bf2017@columbia.edu</a> or 347-255-9824</strong>.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your participation.</p>",

I'm a full-stack developer with 1 year of industry experience and I've been hoping to find a job in NYC. This is taking a while and I'm feeling discouraged by my living situation, so I was thinking about moving to Jersey City and trying to get a temp job while searching. I think being employed in a temporary gig would do a lot for my motivation, and I'd like to be closer to the city for interviews and closer to some of my friends here as well. I don't really have any major expenses, but I probably only have savings for ~2 months of living in Jersey. I wonder if anyone has enough experience with temp agencies (never used one and don't know the process) to tell me if I could expect to find work relatively quickly through one that would let me keep up my search in Jersey. I don't really care what kind of job I do, but I have some teaching experience as well as my tech background if that helps. I graduated in 2016. Advice is appreciated!</p>",

The first year salary amount looks really good, but second year onward a lot depends on Amazon share value, which is making me a little nervous.

            "content": "<p>In practice, I find schedule flexibility is constrained by communication (as you observed).  I've had remote roles where I was working on pieces no one else was touching, and we didn't have frequent synchronous meetings \u2014 those had arbitrary flexibility.  I've also had jobs where the whole team was in the same place, and one always ended up overlapping with other people's work; in those cases there was still usually a fair amount of flex and typically \"core hours\" of 10-3, sometimes formally stated, sometimes not.  The one notable exception was when I worked in China and there was a strict 9am to 6pm schedule, which I hated.  This has generally been the same since I started working in the late 90s, except that I'd characterize schedules as generally getting more flexible over time, and the occasional \"paradigm shift\" fad can get in the way (e.g., agility theater).</p>\n<p>These days I like to start work early, usually around 8am, so I can get work done before most people are around, and then leave around 4pm (or noon, when I'm doing half-days).  Most places have accommodated this trivially, and the last place I worked, a bunch of people I was working with directly followed pretty much the schedule you mention; getting in at lunch or thereafter, and arbitrarily working late as they chose.</p>\n<p>In general, I think it's not hard to find moderately flexible schedules in software (this totally changes when you do software for a company whose business isn't software, though!), and not rare to see schedules like you describe, <em>if</em> the communication constraints are right, <em>and</em> there's a reasonable level of trust from management. (Usually trust only becomes an issue when a group is missing deadlines or there's some power struggle in management above them.)</p>",

One specific tactical point that I am unsure about right now: who has the responsibility for drafting the text of the contract?</p>\n<p>My assumption going into this engagement was that this is something that the client is responsible for. At this point we've agreed to the deliverables and the timetable, but it's taking a long time to move through the process of actually getting a contract together, which is making me increasingly nervous about this project. I'm starting to wonder whether or not it would be in my own interest to draft the contract, and to learn how to draft the contract, myself; and if so, what the best learning resources are on this subject.</p>",

If you go get another offer, you can be a lot more aggressive than 10%, but 10% is pretty safe if you don't want to bother.</li>\n<li>If they say no to that, it's easier to negotiate for a signing bonus than for more comp, often. Not sure what rates are like in London, but in NYC for L6 I'd expect that asking for a $50k USD signing bonus would be pretty easily approved, and you could probably get a lot higher? Not 100% sure about that, though.</li>\n<li>Stock refreshes are pretty hard to predict - they're a combination of standard and performance based. When I left Google (for a job that was offering almost 2x the comp), I was offered a specific stock refresh, so it's something you can negotiate for, but I think usually it's just a pretty standard refresh with maybe some small multiplier based on your performance review.</li>\n</ul>",

We came up with a couple rules to limit distractions; while the hangout is in session, you can come in and leave at any time, but it's heads-down work / no talking time until the start of the next hour, and then we break and hang for 10 min. So 12:00 - 12:10 chat, 12:10 - 1 heads down time. Will post another link if/when I do this again and other peopls can feel free to do the same :)</p>",

And you better make sure you know how to bootstrap an app quick, or have one ready to go. A lot of candidates wasted so much time just getting their environments set up.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I just completed a take home that was untimed, it just need to take less than a week to turn in. That is nice, less pressure, however that ups the ante in terms of expectations now. Since it is untimed, I obsessed over testing everything, coding styles, refactoring a few times till I was satisfied, basically being a perfectionist, and I wasted wayyyyy more time than 2 hours. Probably 16 - 20 over 5 days.</p>\n<p>One added plus is that an onsite (with this last company at least) is shorter, 3hrs, vs full day, since they evaluate you on the take home + interviews. So the take home is not just a thumbs up to the next step.</p>",

(Plus, without context, it can be a real pain to look through them.)</li>\n<li>Whiteboarding is widely reviled as unrealistic and high-pressure, and doesn't really tell me what it's like to work with somebody day-to-day. It also requires the interviewers to have a totally different skillset than they exercise every day, and one that small groups like mine that don't hire often just won't have had a chance to develop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have a suspicion that take-homes might allow the interviewee to show their best side without relying so much on interviewer skill... and to allow more natural interactions. I'd love to have an in-person interview be a discussion of a PR after somebody has had time to think about a problem, rather than putting them on the spot.</p>\n<p>On the candidate side, I've only had two take-homes, and I thought both were fair:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One was timed, and issued just after a video-chat panel interview. Some basic programming questions (level of fizz buzz, but domain specific) along with some more free-form design / domain knowledge questions.</li>\n<li>The second was also time-limited to 2 hours, but on the honor system, and I was given ~4 days including a weekend to submit it. It was well designed to be relevant to the job but also enough of a toy problem that I clearly wasn't doing work for them. It included both a programming challenge and discussion questions, along with a clear expectation that you would not finish in the time allowed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not sure how I would've felt if I was disqualified at this step; as a successful candidate, I appreciated that I had established my programming skills before arriving for the on-site, so after a single whiteboard question to validate my skills, they moved on to the sales pitch and more interesting discussions about the organization.</p>",

Both were well organized, clearly specified (one was actually real code on the real site for the company), and involved a discussion afterwards. Great to see the real code, great to see the process in real life, and kinda like a really fast \"contract-to-hire\". Got the offers.</p>\n<p>Another great one was a straightforward, clear PR for a well-specified GitHub issue that was used for all candidates at the startup. The code was actually <em>reviewed</em> and then there was a discussion with the team in a positive, collaborative way. Got the offer.</p>\n<p>I've done a handful of pairing interviews, which is what I tend to implement when I'm on the hiring side. Those tend to go well, though I'm 50/50 with offers in that scenario. </p>\n<p>The majority of the rest, while generally \"clear\" for some definition of clear, were really open-ended with poor followthrough on questions about details (\"use your best judgement\") and then perfunctory (\"not what we're looking for\") responses. Three of these were \"write an API endpoint in Rails\", which is only a few steps past \"a blog in 15m\" so should be a good demo of basic skills. Turned in app, running rspec with codecoverage and rubocop settings deployed to heroku with CI. Not what we're looking for.... <span aria-label=\"poop\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f4a9\" role=\"img\" title=\"poop\">:poop:</span> </p>\n<p>There's some garbage you'll hear about \"the liability\" if they tell you your code is bad. Never been a case brought to trial or known to settle that proved that. There's the \"its too much work\" -- if you're already reviewing the code for the person, you've _already done_ the work so putting that review, which inevitably is in a greenhouse/recruiterbox/whatever tool, pasting it in and giving feedback is great.</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong, I've been bad in some coding challenges. I'm not going to do great on leetcode because in 28+ years of writing code professionally I've had to write a sort function or travel a B tree or wahtever maybe 2 times. Total. And I just don't care that much :) I've gone in for a Ruby gig and had an interview in Elm. I've had a python test that i did worse than random on (not a big python dev here). I've walked out of two interviews where they had a computer set up for the interview to be \"fair\" that *literally didn't have a code editor other than notepad.exe on it\". </p>\n<p>I think hiring sends signals about the company and I know that the huge majority of good experiences I've had have been with smaller companies (&lt;100) with good engineering culture and a bespoke-to-adhoc hiring process. And that's where i like to be. Filtering resumes is terrible, vetting programmers is hard, and even with that its not a guarantee you're the right dev for THAT job.</p>\n<p>Keep trying, realize like dating the signal you might be getting that is negative from the first date is likely a signal its going to be just as bad in a relationship :)</p>",

Here\u2019s what I love about them:\n\n1. Turns out it\u2019s very difficult to get honest feedback about how our behaviour affects people, especially when those people work for us. You don\u2019t have to be a bad manager for this to be true: so many folks have had such mediocre experiences with management that giving honest feedback feels dangerous, no matter how much you insist that you\u2019re open to it and want to hear it.\n\n2. I ask a bunch of non-standard questions, like: \u201cA friend of yours starts working for &lt;subject&gt;. What advice do you give them?\u201d I find that by getting interviewees to engage creatively, I get deliciously rich feedback that otherwise wouldn\u2019t surface.\n\n3. I end every 360 with the question: \u201cIs there anything else you want me to know?\u201d The most consistent piece of feedback I get here is: &quot;Thanks for doing this. It shows that &lt;subject&gt;  really cares about their team.\u201d\n\nI used to only run 360s as a kick-off to a coaching engagement. I\u2019m prototyping a new offering: for the next four weeks, I\u2019m selling them as a stand-alone package and I\u2019m giving all the proceeds to Covid relief. If you buy a package, you can pick from one of several recommended organizations or choose your own.\n\nIf that sounds fun for you, grab half an hour with me (https://calendly.com/peterjohnchapman/30-minute-call) and I\u2019ll talk you through the process.\n\nCheers,\nPeter\n\nPS: If you want to just donate directly, here are three organizations I like: Feeding America, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and Know Your Rights Camp.```\n</pre></div>",

            "content": "<p>Just wanted to share some random thoughts about the remote interviewing process...</p>\n<p>I've been dreading interviewing for a while, and then COVID happened, and interviewing remotely seemed like it would be doubly terrible. But surprisingly, it hasn't been as bad as one might think. For one thing, the initial interview stages have been remote for many companies, even before covid. The first step is usually a phone screen by a recruiter, typically followed by a paired coding exercise in <a href=\"http://coderpad.io\">coderpad.io</a>, or something similar. The final step would traditionally be the on-site interview, and now it's a \"virtual\" on-site. So it's primarily the final step that's different.</p>\n<p>Here are a few reasons why a \"virtual\" on-site might be preferable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don't have to worry about what you're wearing (not to the same extent that you normally would). It's still worth putting on a nice top and being presentable from the waist up, but no need to worry about uncomfortable shoes, or whether you ironed your outfit enough</li>\n<li>Don't have to stress over the commute of getting to the interview. This might more NY-centric, but public transportation will always act up when you are most in a hurry. If you gave yourself 60 minutes for a trip that would normally take 50 minutes, the day of the interview will be the day when every train is delayed and you just miss every connection you need. But if you give yourself 80 minutes for a 50 minute trip, then everything will run perfectly smooth. The local train will magically run express, your 50 minute trip will only take 20 minutes, and you will find yourself at your interview way too early, with an hour of time to kill, and now you're wandering around the city because you can't arrive too early but you really have nowhere else to go. With a virtual interview, there's no commute to worry about.</li>\n<li>Clothing and commute must also be considered in tandem with the weather. Will sweat stains appear if you get too hot? How will the rain or snow affect your commute? If there's a chance of rain, better pack an umbrella - it would suck to arrive at your interview soaking wet.</li>\n<li>When you're in person, you will be judged on everything you do from the moment you enter the building. Assume that every encounter with anyone you meet is being judged. You're also being assessed on your body language. When you're virtual, you mainly need to control your facial expressions.</li>\n<li>Then when the interview is over, you're relieved, but also need to decide what to do with the remaining nervous energy you might have. If you're like me, you were probably too nervous to eat before your interview. Should you eat out, or just head straight home? When your virtual interview is over, simply disconnect from your meeting and go make yourself a snack! <span aria-label=\"slight smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>For anyone else who has been virtual interviewing, how has your experience been? (I think virtual onboarding will be a whole other story -- no thoughts how I feel about that yet. We'll see when (knock-on wood) I get there)</p>",

I just keep this document open while I'm working.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A Timer</strong>: It's super helpful to have a few timers running to help keep the  interview on track and know when to move on. Just make sure it's quite.. and not too distacting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Music</strong>: I personally like playing chill music through my headphones while I chat.

I know that I can just google it, but I'm having trouble finding useful descriptions of what the day-to-day of different jobs looks like. For my batch I've been learning HTML/CSS/JS for web development, because I'm betting that's the most reliable way to get employed given how little experience I have. But even in that area, it's not clear to me what a back-end engineer does vs a front-end. Does the front-end only work with the html/css? At one point in the chain of browser to server does the frontend end and the backend begin? </p>\n<p>And that's just web-dev, which to be honest I'm not 100% committed to. I don't know what's out there and I don't know enough to know what questions to ask. Would anyone feel comfortable describing their job, and what they do on a daily basis? How did you learn about your job and get interested? What can I look up to better educate myself on what sort of roles are out there?</p>\n<p>Thanks everyone!</p>",

E.g., maybe you'd get $150k cash from a big company (see <a href=\"https://www.levels.fyi/\">https://www.levels.fyi/</a>) but $100k + equity from a startup. It might be helpful to frame the choice as \"would I invest $50k in this company and to work with my friend?\"</li>\n</ol>",

My partner switched careers to get into tech and was a junior at a 20ish person startup.

Some of that you can get from crunchbase, and early stage startups might have only gotten an angel round (though if they're hiring at all it's likely they've gotten some form of significant VC already...). The magic word, though, is \"runway\" which is a cutesy metaphor to describe \"how much money do we have (incl prospective revenue in some cases) and how long can we keep going before running out of 'runway' where 'we' are in a plane trying to take off and the possible outcomes are 1. take off and FLY WOW look at that AIRPLANE or crash off the end of the runway sad trombone\".</p>\n<p>You may not feel comfortable grilling them on their balance sheets, and that's ok! but I think a good place will be willing to talk about that stuff in general at least and be ok with giving you a sense of where they are at.</p>",

That'll be my chance to really ask about the questions you guys brought up. Thanks for the great list!</p>\n<p>And on that topic, I have never done an on-site interview before. I'm going to be out of town from the 30th to the 3rd, and I was hoping to squeeze in a mock interview. I asked in RC jobs chat, and since the timeline is so tight they suggested I ask here. Is there anyone willing to give a mock interview on short notice? I understand that my schedule basically means today or tomorrow, unless they schedule the interview for sometime later next week (assuming I make it that far). I should warn I'm expecting it to go badly since I'm so new to all this. I have no idea what sort of questions get asked outside of leetcode stuff. I don't even know if this startup is going to focus on algorithms? I just think having the experience of going through an interview once before hand will help a lot with setting expectations, and getting a good mindset for the real interview.</p>",

And if not, I'd at least want to be fully aware of what I committed to.</p>",

            "content": "<p>you can think of it as a butt-covering exercise: if in the future your company decides that a thing you worked on in your spare time is actually theirs, having that thing listed on this form in your contract goes a long way for a judge to decide prima facie that the claim is ludicrous. There may be other more technical routes to also demonstrate that, it just makes your lawyers jobs easier. In all likelihood this will never happen and your company won\u2019t try and sue you for stealing \u201ctheir\u201d IP, however there is a small chance and anything you do to minimize that chance or make your future lawyers\u2019 lives easier is saving you possible legal fees. In the end IMO there\u2019s enough upside for being careful and listing a bunch of stuff that might be relevant to your employer that it\u2019s worth going through the exercise.</p>",
