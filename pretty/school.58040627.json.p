I would appreciate continuing undergrad but not really interested into following physics as career anymore.</p>\n<p>I found this school: <a href=\"http://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/meng-in-computer-science-re/industry-engagement-cs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/meng-in-computer-science-re/industry-engagement-cs\">http://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/meng-in-computer-science-re/industry-engagement-cs</a><br>\ndoes anyone has/knows someone who has had experience with this? The same question goes to juggling work with school. I talked to my manager and they seemed pretty flexible in mostly everything and even suggested that for periods of time in which I'll need time for school I could be given less work for that week or sth. Also my company will pay for part of tuition so that's nice.</p>\n<p>I need advice in whether to know if this is a good idea or not. </p>",
