There are also questions about whether grad school is right or not for them. </p>\n<p>One of the awesome things about the RC community is we have many members who have gone through this process and therefore have a lot of useful tidbits of advice!

(I don't personally like this one, but it's just an example.) Then, I can fill out the template electronically, print it, bind it, and add some blank space to write down handwritten notes if needed. This way, I hope I can keep some organization in my physical notebook/binder and I could at least search through the template that I have filled out and keep in the computer.</p>",

I literally have done zero to prepare my docs for the application (inc. GRE, TOEFL, other formalities etc...) So I wonder if it makes any sense to get things started now and try to cram everything in for the GRE and get the rest sorted, or I should just postpone it all for next year? I heard that sometimes professors are ok with taking people after the deadline.... So if I'd try to reach out to professors directly, that could potentially get me further than trying to go through the official procedure. But then again I have no idea.. Any thoughts on this?</p>",

I'm not sure about TOEFL but we're still 2 or 3 months out from the application deadlines so I think you still probably have time... and like Stephen said, even if you take it now and don't end up having the results in time for the deadlines then they're still good for the following year.  Some schools have applications due through January, take a look at when the specific deadlines are for the schools you're considering.<br>\nOther than the exams, you need some rec letters and a personal statement, and you definitely have plenty of time to get those done.<br>\nAs far as professors taking students not through the official procedure, in my limited experience this isn't possible. I had a friend who secured her own funding for grad school with the NSF fellowship, but she found this out after grad school applications were due and tried to reach out to some professors to see if she could get into schools she didn't apply to or was rejected from without funding (since she had her own) and at least the people she talked to said they couldn't do anything for her. This might not always be the case, and either way reaching out to professors you would want to work with before hand is probably a good idea- especially if you happen to have some professors you've worked with/ who know you, who can put you in contact with people you'd like to work with.</p>",

Professors tend to work with other professors, so it barely happens that you get to know a professor personally and start collaborating. But well.. this may be me trying to comfort myself on not having done this. Anyways, it's no point thinking about this. What I'm worried about is not just not having research experience because of this, but also the lack of my personal relationships with professors. I really don't know who I could ask that would write a realistic, honest reflection on my work ethic, my attitude, personality, and achievements.. Any thoughts on this?

Prepping for and taking the GRE is something you can conceivably do in a few days - the test is not hard, you just need to get in a few practice tests(maybe 2-3) to familiarize yourself with the format and get used to taking it on a computer. CS Departments only care about the quantitative section anyhow and it is not difficult to score over 160 on it.</p>\n<p>Regarding cold emailing profs: I didn't do this and still got into a bunch of schools. It can't hurt of course, but I would not see it as something you really need to do. The statement of purposes are also fairly fluff and can be written over the course of 2 weeks. </p>\n<p>The most pressing concern is where you're going to get your recommendations - but really this is probably out of your control since it's not really feasible in 2ish months to find a professor to work with AND build enough of a rapport to get a reference out of them. But who knows, maybe it is possible. Even if you don't think you have an application strong enough for this cycle, it doesn't really hurt(I guess it does hurt in terms of paying application fees) to apply and reapply next year if necessary. But roll the dice, bet on yourself, and see what happens.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Hi all -<br>\nI'm one month into my PhD program and I feel like I'm getting the hang of it. I'm no longer running around only to be on time with readings/homework. However, I'm struggling with the fact that, although I'm (mostly) on top of my immediate responsibilities, I never feel like \"I'm Done\". Every time i finish something, there's always more things to do, and there's little chance to take a break. I don't mean to say it's overwhelming, or to complain that there is too much to do. For example, in my undergrad, I would do my stuff every week and I would be \"Done\" by Thursday or Friday and then I was free to wait/get ready for the next deadline. In my job, I would be done with some projects in a couple of months at the most. Now in grad school, even though I'm not lagging behind, I feel like I stop working because it's time to eat/exercise/sleep, not because \"I'm Done\".<br>\nI think the major reason behind this is that the principal KPI is quantity/quality of papers published (as opposed to grades in bi-weekly quizzes in undergrad or frequent release dates in software development), and I'm afraid I won't feel like I'm Done until I publish a paper, which is certainly a much longer time frame than the ~monthly task turnover I'm used to. <br>\nIn writing this I realize I might be getting ahead of myself as I'm only one month in, but I'd still be glad to hear y'all's comments about this.<br>\nWhat intermediate milestones do you look forward to in grad school, that are more frequent than publishing papers? I'm talking about daily (when to take breaks/exercise/call it a day), or weekly, monthly, etc. Anything that helps you evaluate how much progress you've made.<br>\nThanks!</p>",

The first item of the meeting would simply involve evaluating this week's latex additions. I've sort of adapted this for my own purposes, and one of the side effects is that I now have a list of papers, summaries, and equations that I can basically copy/paste for paper drafts and assignments.

I read this thread on Monday, and really liked your idea about having a dedicated research day- so I tried that today, and I feel like that worked so much better for me. So thanks! Similarly to what Adrien was saying and what Lindsey had said about classes, I felt like I was working 12 hours days for the first few weeks, and then I decided I was going to let the small stuff slide, and also consciously make time to do thing I thought were important. So I set aside time to do non-school things like see friends and family, and then just try to focus the rest of the time- and if it's like midnight and I didn't finish one of the problems on an assignment I just turn it in and don't worry about it. I'm not sure if academically that's the best plan, but I've been much happier since I decided I was only going to work so much in a day. I just think that if I'm not spending my time doing things that I think are neither productive or fulfilling - like watching TV, or reddit, which are things I used to do- then I'm satisfied that I did \"enough\" with my day.</p>",

I'm having a hard time customizing the default LaTex CV templates (on <a href=\"http://sharelatex.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://sharelatex.com\">sharelatex.com</a>) as they seem to break from any additional styling that may come from other themes. I'm looking for a column CV where I can list my education+work experience next to my projects and research. The main issue i had with the ones I found was the fact that I cannot add an additional \"\\documentclass{tccv}\" where tccv is the theme. So if I try to add a standard \\social{bla bla....} it just doesn't like it, as it's expecting the type of syntax structure the theme was built on. Does anyone have an idea for a fix for this? Also, was wondering if any of you have a cool LaTex template that you wouldn't mind sharing? Thanks! :)</p>",

At some point, especially as things became less class-focused and more research-focused, I decided to set really specific times for when I work and when I don't. I work 40 hour work weeks and no weekends (although I do respond to email all of the time, which is probably a bad habit). <br>\nI think this is rare for grad students, but I don't think it has reduced my productivity at all.

I\u2019d like to get your thoughts/advice on a couple things:</p>\n<p>1) Best practices for talking with professors? My current plan is to just talk about my background/research interests and ask well-educated questions about theirs. Is there anything else that you\u2019d recommend?</p>\n<p>2) Choosing a research area: I\u2019ve been doing some work on deep RL recently and really enjoying it. It seems like a neat, emerging field that maps extremely well to a number of real-world problems (eg. robotics, agriculture, etc). It has some great theoretical and engineering problems, but the application side is hugely inspiring to me too. At some deep level, I want to know that I\u2019m making a positive difference in the world. I also like DL in general because the research is super open and moving fast (lots of open source, datasets and models being shared, etc)</p>\n<p>Since deep RL is such a new field (and has mostly been dominated by Berkeley and Deepmind), there aren\u2019t too many profs outside of said institutions that have published in this area. Am I limiting myself by stating a specific interest in RL and only focusing on professors with an interest in it? Should I focus on DL profs more broadly?</p>\n<p>The additional context of this is that my advisor from an undergrad is somewhat well known in the optimization world and knows Ben Recht (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"tu.stephenl@gmail.com\">@Stephen Tu</span>'s advisor) and intro\u2019d me the other day. We haven\u2019t spoken yet but I know Ben\u2019s research focus is more on stochastic optimization and theoretical ML although I think he is trying to move into DL more. I\u2019m def interested in his group, but a part of me worries that I wouldn\u2019t be a good fit it is not as applied (correct me if i'm wrong). So I guess I\u2019m just curious about the tradeoff between going more the applied vs theoretical research route. What are the pros and cons of both? Besides the \u201ccool ideas\u201d, what motivates/inspires you about your research?</p>",

On the Natural Language side, Cho et al. is working on using RL to make realtime translation systems and Bowman is using RL in the context of Neural Turing Machine type models, and Weston is using RL for dialog systems. Martin Arjovsky just started as Leon Bottou's student and he's been giving RL lectures as part of the reading group. I'm not exactly sure what he's working on, but he did an RL internship at Facebook. Also, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar has built an environment called MazeBase to test RL agents (he's also at FAIR). I didn't realize, but I guess that they were able to train models in MazeBase that generalized to Starcraft which is pretty nifty.</p>",

It is one you can start learning early on because, even in technically difficult fields, simple patterns of questioning often recur in many forms across papers.  E.g., in the theory of computing, if there is a new model of computation being studied, it is likely to have randomized or nondeterministic versions that can be studied next.  Or if there is an algorithmic problem, it might have variant problems to be solved in, say, the communication protocol or decision-tree models.  And so on.</p>\n<p>Even though it is not so difficult to produce these variations, few people do so systematically.  If you keep at it, and keep trying to learn and adopt more patterns of questioning, you will hit upon interesting and solvable problems.  You will also start to develop a taste about which problems are likely to be most interesting, which are too hard, and so on.  (Side note---I believe that keeping a research journal with your questions greatly helps this process.)</p>\n</blockquote>",

            "content": "<p>My phd program gives me until the end of my first year to choose an advisor, so I don\u2019t current have an advisor but need to decide who I want to work with with somewhat increasing urgency, and I\u2019m really conflicted on how to make this decision. Part of the problem is that I\u2019ve got a really wide range of interests, so there are many people I *could* work with, but I\u2019m sort of scared to commit to a single area/ professor/ project. <br>\n.<br>\nSpecifically, my concerns are:<br>\n1. I\u2019m worried about how relevant possible thesis topics in various areas could be- like there\u2019s one professor who I think I could really like working with, but he\u2019s an expert on integer overflow in C++ and I suspect this was a really valuable thing to become an expert in when he did his phd 30 years ago- but looking to the the future, I\u2019m not sure this will still be a relevant problem in another 30 years\u2026 so I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll get to the end of 5 years and realize I\u2019ve just gained a bunch of expertise that won\u2019t be relevant in another 5. Similarly there\u2019s a professor in computer architecture I might like working with, but -from a pretty uninformed standpoint- it seems like architecture gains aren\u2019t a \u201cbig open problem\u201d in Computer Science (like I have a pretty middle-range laptop and I can more-or-less comfortably compile really big code bases).<br>\n2. Conversely I\u2019m not sure whether I care about how much potential for societal impact my research has\u2026 for instance, I think applications of machine learning can have a lot of impact (ie. biomedical) but it\u2019s also very commercialized, and I\u2019m worried that if I become an expert in ML I\u2019ll wind up serving ads\u2026 which somehow doesn\u2019t feel like a very good \u201cwhy are we even doing this\u201d end goal, though I know that turns into philosophy really fast. On the other hand, I think it could be fun to think about some really niche thing (like there's a professor working on retooling the haskell macro system) but that's not going to (directly) contribute to things like curing cancer... so I'm not sure whether I should be worried about how much impact my work might have on the real life quality of other people's lives.<br>\n3. I\u2019m really actually worried about committing to a field for 5 years. More specifically I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll get 2 years in, get bored, get a job offer and ditch- and I\u2019m worried because two of the faculty I think I\u2019m mostly likely to realistically work with are really young professors who are still a long way from getting tenure and both really nice people- and I\u2019m worried that if I ditch halfway through my phd I\u2019ll really do them a disservice for investing time and funding into me if I don\u2019t turn out any useful work. I\u2019m also sort of worried because I\u2019m, at least superficially, interested in just about every part of cs- computers are so cool! -but the field I thought I was going to be working in last year I\u2019m less interested in this year, and the field that I\u2019m more interested in this year, we don\u2019t really have any good advisor candidates in. <br>\n4. I\u2019m not sure whether, given the above 3 points, I should just go with the professor I think is going to be the most fun to work with. I suspect I know who this is, but I\u2019m slightly less interested in their research/ field than other fields. I\u2019m not sure if this is also superficial- maybe it\u2019s really cool and I just need to convince myself of that.<br>\n.<br>\nSorry for the wall of text! I\u2019m not really sure what to do, but I\u2019d love to hear any ideas, experiences, stories, advice, whatever.</p>",

I'm not saying you should work with this particular person (you should work with someone whose research you're excited about), but I really wouldn't worry too much about whether you're studying something marketable and trendy.  It's more important that you and your advisor like each other and are both excited about the topic, and that your advisor can provide you good technical mentorship on the topic and help introduce you to the research community.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m really actually worried about committing to a field for 5 years.

A huge percentage of Ph.D. students quit.  Sooner or later, people in your cohort will start quitting.  The professor who takes you on will understand that that's a risk.  You're not under obligation to stick around if you're unhappy just to help them get tenure.  Them getting tenure is their problem, not yours.  That might sound harsh, but really, your life is hard enough as a grad student without also feeling responsible for their tenure case.  You need to look out for yourself.  And anyway, if you publish some good papers with them and then leave, that'll still help their tenure case.</p>",

I just feel like I don't have a thesis topic in mind, though I am trying to read a lot of different papers and look for problems to solve, so I don't know who I should work with of the  people I think would be good candidates because I'm not sure what I would want to do under them.

I'm interested in ML/DL as a field because of the impressive results of neural networks on tasks like image recognition and the potential for new models to change the landscape in fields like healthcare. I've always had a bend towards math but it truthfully wasn't until very recently when 1) I saw the AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol game and 2) I was increasingly hearing about new ML initiatives at the electronic medical records (EMR) company I was working at that I knew I wanted to learn more about it. I realize that a PhD might be too big of a step forward given my background but I've had very positive experiences with previous research jobs and it seems to me that I may need to be in research/\"the long haul\" if I want to do the work that seems \"truly\" interesting to me (a bit vague, I know).</p>",

I think it's quite common to enter a CS Ph.D. program with an undergrad math degree.  You'll spend the first couple years of the Ph.D. taking classes and doing the equivalent of an MS in CS on the way to the Ph.D. anyway, so you might as well apply to Ph.D. programs that will actually fund you during those years, as opposed to MS programs that typically won't.  In fact, doing an MS can actually count against you -- MS programs are often full of people who have no interest in going on to a Ph.D. and you may have a hard time convincing would-be future advisors not to think of you that way.  Furthermore, sadly, MS students are often treated like cash cows by the university, and get little respect from faculty or administrators compared to Ph.D. students. (Ph.D. students aren't exactly the most well-treated themselves, but more so than MS students, at least.)  So I'd urge you to go for the Ph.D.  You can always leave the program with an MS in a couple of years if you decide that's what you'd prefer.</p>",

The reason is that, except in a few limited cases, the good research opportunities generally don't go to MS students.  (Edit: this applies to research universities in the US -- Europe is a different story.)</p>\n<p>Faculty often don't want to invest their scarce time/money in advising MS students, because the students will be around for such a short time.  As soon as the student gets up to speed on a project, they'll be graduating.</p>\n<p>Also, there are more MS students than Ph.D. students, so you'd have to work hard to differentiate yourself and get profs' attention.  If you don't, you'll just be another face in the crowd in large lecture classes, and the faculty might not ever even learn your name.</p>\n<p>Finally, people often (correctly or incorrectly) assume that MS students aren't serious about eventually being Real Researchers, or otherwise they'd be doing a Ph.D.  And since the admissions standards for MS students aren't as high, faculty don't want to take chances on them.  You would have to be extremely proactive, work really hard to demonstrate your worthiness, and fight to get funding.</p>\n<p>I suspect that some of the bias against MS students is just plain old racism and xenophobia (~70% of CS MS students in the US are not US citizens, and most of those are from India or China; for Ph.D. students, that percentage is still high, but not <em>as</em> high).</p>",

I suppose that's a somewhat subjective quality, but I'm working on the same projects, and doing the same kinds of things in those projects, as their PhD students. I also know PhD students who haven't been able to get onto at least one of the projects I've worked on. Relative to the first year PhD students I know, I've gotten much more exposure to interesting research projects.  It's also true that one of the most prolific PhD students in the lab I'm currently working in first did an MS (during which he did lots of interesting research).</p>\n<p>I don't think there's anything special about me in this scenario, though I do think it helps to be proactive. This is just to say to say that whatever the general situation of how Academia views an MS, there are certainly ways of getting quite a lot of knowledge, and more germane to this thread, research experience / professor investment out of an MS.</p>\n<p>My situation is different to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"chungjsm@gmail.com\" data-user-id=\"100445\">@Mike Chung (W2'17)</span> in that I wasn't planning on doing a PhD going into the MS (now I'm less sure), but I think there are a few good reasons you might want to consider one. In my case, by the time I finish the MS I'll have a lot more experience, and hopefully a couple publications, in my field of interest, which will make it easier for me to get researchers in that field to take me seriously if I do decide to go the PhD route.</p>",

I wrote this statement over the last two days and have to submit the application tomorrow night.  If anyone has a moment to look over it quickly, it would be much appreciated :)</p>",

You don't have to necessarily write about the plan B in your SOP, but it's worth keeping in the back of your mind.  That said, again, the fact that you were asked to apply out of cycle suggests that they have a specific role in this lab that they would like you to fill and that there is already funding lined up.

Before the rebuttal, we had 1) strong reject, 1) strong accept, and 1) weak accept. Naturally, the majority of this rebuttal was targeted towards the comments made by the strong reject reviewer. Luckily, our arguments were able to convince the strong reject into a weak accept, which the area chair then decided merited a publication. Honestly, I feel quite lucky it turned out that way-- it usually does not unfortunately. Hope this helps</p>",

Is this your first rebuttal experience?  If so, congrats on your first (really) -- it's a milestone and you should celebrate it even if it doesn't feel like much fun.</p>\n<p>A couple bits of advice:</p>\n<p>* It's hard to change the outcome by targeting just the negative reviews in the rebuttal.  Instead, if reviews are mixed, the goal of the rebuttal should be to give more ammunition to the most positive reviewers so that they can advocate for you and help bring the negative reviewers around.  (If there are no positive reviewers, then the paper probably isn't getting in this time.  Try, try again!)<br>\n  * I like SPJ's classic advice (from slide 45 of <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/icfp-plmw15/slides/peyton-jones.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/icfp-plmw15/slides/peyton-jones.pdf\">this talk</a>): if they misunderstood the paper, \"DO NOT respond \u201cyou stupid person, I meant X\u201d. Fix the paper so that X is apparent even to the stupidest reader.\"<br>\n  * Take all advice, including this advice, with a grain of salt.  I don't necessarily know anything about how things work in your subfield, so my advice may not apply.</p>",

            "content": "<p>I wouldn't call it a big issue (if anything it's a good problem to have), but I'm thinking about applying next year for grad school rather than this one.</p>\n<p>Reasons to delay:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm working full-time and will give me a little more flexibility in the future. I say this because I'll have a slightly bigger bank account, as I'll have worked 2 years instead of 1 as a research engineer before starting school.</li>\n<li>Along the same lines, it seems a little more considerate to my colleagues. I think it's totally fair to switch companies after that amount of time in this industry.</li>\n<li>I hurt my leg pretty badly about a month ago. The timing was a little unfortunate because I was working on a couple interesting projects that would have been a great resume boost, but probably won't happen until after application deadlines.</li>\n<li>The recovery for the injury isn't too great. I won't be able to walk for another 3 months, and then need to do physical therapy. It might make sense to drop as many responsibilities as I can and focus on my health (I tend to do the opposite).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reasons to apply now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I applied last year and was close-ish. I applied to 5 competitive schools and had 2 interviews, but ultimately was rejected.</li>\n<li>This time I'd apply probably to 15-20 schools or so. They're all still competitive, but I think that alone will increase my chances.</li>\n<li>Since applying I've published 2 preprints that have gotten a few citations already. I didn't have any writing of this caliber last time around.</li>\n<li>I'm working as research engineer for deep learning at a well-known company. Previously I had only worked as a software engineer at a couple lesser known startups.</li>\n<li>Last year I had 1 relevant recommendation letter (professor that I've worked with in the field) and 2 letters from people that knew me well but weren't in academia. This year I'll have 2 relevant recommendation letters, and hopefully one from a colleague that did his PhD in Machine Learning / NLP.</li>\n<li>There's probably no harm in applying again this year, even if I decide to delay later.</li>\n<li>The field I'm interested in is becoming increasingly more trendy \u2014\u00a0PhD slots might be harder to come by next year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope you all don't mind my thinking out loud here. Any comments are welcome! My biggest question is whether it's worth it to stay in industry for another year (because that makes this decision a lot easier), or whether I'm inadvertently making it more difficult to apply next year. I'm 50/50 right now on what to do.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Hey all! I'm applying to grad school for a few Masters programs this year, and have a couple of questions for which I've found it difficult to get answers to -</p>\n<p>1. Is it okay to have (and indicate) a stronger inclination towards pursuing coursework in a Masters program as opposed to engaging in research? I have a non-CS background, and hence my primary goal in a masters is to strengthen my ML/math fundamentals through coursework, and engage in at least some research. Most advice I find online tells me to do the opposite - demonstrate a clear interest in research, and highlight my research experience, even for programs that seem coursework oriented.</p>\n<p>2. This is a rather open-ended question - I have a pretty bad academic undergraduate record, and my most formative experiences have been significant open source contributions and professional experience in my fields of interest. I find that my (non-CS) undergraduate degree had a really insignificant impact on my life, but unfortunately most schools seem to really value academic achievement (and probably justifiably so). I'd really appreciate any general advice on how to frame my slightly unconventional, non-academic experience in a way that would actually matter to an admissions committee.</p>\n<p>This is a long shot, but suggestions for any programs/universities which are, in general, more permissive with academic backgrounds, and that holistically evaluate a candidate would be extremely helpful too. (If it helps, the field I'm most interested in is NLP - the NLP focused univs that I'm considering so far are Columbia, UNC Chapel Hill and CMU).</p>\n<p>Any other general advice would be appreciated too. Thanks!</p>",

I tried to read papers and \"do research\", but none of it went anywhere. I would say this is pretty representative of most first years in EECS (some are special and already know way more so they can be more productive). It was pretty depressing. I would look up the publication record of the successful people in the field, and see how many papers they had in their first and second year, and I would feel bad for not being on par with them. I don't really recommend doing this.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of my first year, I was lucky enough to convince one of our postdocs to work with me on a problem that my adviser had proposed to me. I basically bothered him enough about it that he helped me get unstuck, and we wrote up a paper about it. This is now my most cited machine learning paper. It would have not happened w/o collaboration, which I encourage. I would say that the best paper I have written in grad school was the result of an interdisciplinary collaboration. </p>\n<p>So in summary, two things: (1) feeling unproductive is normal. in fact, i would say this is one of the defining characteristics of grad school. (2) collaborating is good, esp in the beginning. while i understand the appeal of the lone genius working in a dungeon who comes up w/ a brilliant, earth shattering idea and gets to claim all the credit, there are some nice advantages to collaborating.</p>",

            "content": "<p>I will echo many things already said above, only because they are extremely important to keep in mind: grad school experience is really personal and depends on a number of factors, feeling unproductive is the norm (99% of people I know have imposter's syndrome, including established professors), and it's really hard to know when to stop.</p>\n<p>1. Your personal experience will depend mainly on your adviser/lab/close collaborators. Having an adviser is a weird kind of relationship. In my case, my adviser is equal parts mentor, boss, professor, collaborator, and add a dash of friendship. Learning to navigate this relationship may take some time.</p>\n<p>2. In order to diminish the feeling of being unproductive I recommend finding a way to document your time. Blog, research log, weekly meetings/check-ins (even if it's only with yourself), etc. I struggled HARD and burned out HARD on my first semester because there was very little structure and/or feedback. I came from environments (college, programming) where introspection and feedback were a constant (grades, quick development cycles, resp.) and in grad school I had NONE of that. I had to create my own structures to keep track of where I am and where my time is going.</p>\n<p>3. Both points above are not separate. Let me illustrate with a personal case. On a given week, I do research and I stop working when I have a meeting's worth of material to discuss with adviser/collaborators. Now, my current research project is equal parts mathematics, algorithm design, and network science. My adviser is a hard-core data mining and ML person, while I have a BS in math. When the project takes a math-y turn, it sometimes takes me a couple days' worth of work to fill a meeting's worth of material, which means I have the rest of the week to tend to coursework, keeping up with the literature, or even take a day off. However, when the project turns more ML-y, it takes me longer to fill a meeting's worth of progress and I might have to work nights and de-prioritize other responsibilities. Thus, your experience, as well as how to keep track of your progress, will depend on your project, your strengths, your adviser's/collaborator's/your expectations, other responsibilities you might have (like TAing, coursework, or attending talks and conferences), etc. One of the parts I have struggled the most with is with finding regularity in my days/weeks.</p>\n<p>3.5 A note on finding regularity: since I have weekly meetings with my research group, I try to schedule my week in advance. I try to designate a \"reading day\" (say Monday), a \"research day\", \"homework day\" and so on, and try as hard as possible to stick to those designations. Otherwise, it's easy to sink in the feeling that I have too many balls in the air at the same time.</p>\n<p>4. My best recommendation is, humbly: make the best plan you possibly can, but be ready to toss it and adapt, improvise, and learn.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Yeah, sorry, didn't mean to hijack the thread! (But that's really interesting Leo- I keep most of my notes in physical notebooks but write a lot of little snippets / todos digitally)</p>\n<p>re: the original thread, here are some of my thoughts-- for context, I'm a second year PhD student in CS. </p>\n<p>re: productivity expectations- I try to set up my schedule to minimize burnout by building in non-working time. For instance, I mandatorily go climbing on Monday and Thursday nights, I have time blocks allocated to have dinner with friends and family, and I don't skip out on sleep, even if it means showing up to a meeting with slightly less done than I wanted to have done. I'll skip these things infrequently if somethings urgent, but I try really hard not to. And I do these things even if I was having a really unproductive and unfocused day and didn't get anything done. I have sometimes showed up to meetings and said hey I was really busy with X this week and I didn't really make any progress on this, and my advisor has been really supportive &amp; understanding. I find that having very small specific goals helps motivate me to get things done rather than lofty goals like \"work on the project\", and often if I spend an afternoon procrastinating that's a sign that I'm stuck on something and I need to find someone to talk to about what I'm stuck on. </p>\n<p>re: establishing a good working relationship with an advisor- my lab uses slack which is really awesome because I can easily send my advisor a quick message when I have a question about something- I feel like when I tried doing research as an undergrad I felt like I didn't want to bug the prof I was working with so I'd get stuck on these problems for days that I should have just quickly resolved. I think if we didn't use slack I might keep an ongoing email thread of small questions. I take notes at my meetings and make sure I have a list of actionable items to work on for the next week.</p>\n<p>Similar to what Stephen said above, I try not to compare my track record to people successful in the field. I try to optimize based on whether what I'm doing is interesting as my personal metric of success- someone once gave me the piece of advice that they're not paying you enough to not be having a good time. So re: working on the right problem, if I'm working on something I think is interesting (or has some part that I think is interesting or has potential) that's the right problem. Bonus points if anyone else seems interested/ willing to use what I produce. Sometimes I think the thing I'm working on is no longer interesting because I'm sick of it and being able to take a break to think about something else helps with that. Beyond that I really love <a href=\"https://blog.acolyer.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.acolyer.org/\">the Morning Paper</a> and just try to read widely to be on the lookout of things I find interesting.</p>",

I might try experimenting with some structure this semester to see if it helps.</p>\n<p>I'm saying this to encourage those who are not as detailed oriented and on top of things.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: my adviser used to insist that we do weekly checkins on slack. I heavily resisted and refused to submit anything (I believe this is one of the most demoralizing things you can do, to see everybody else's successes every week. it makes it basically impossible to not play the comparison game). I would be more OK with this if it was private, but there wasn't a good workflow for this on slack (DMs don't scale well to a group of &gt; 10 people). We no longer do this.</p>",

I've got a friend who is a European citizen who is currently an undergrad studying CS in Denmark, who is interested in finding ways to get involved in research and I thought to suggest an REU except that my impression was REUs were mostly for US citizens because they were funded largely by the NSF which is funded by US taxes, though I saw at least one program that accepts non-US citizens with some other funding source. Does anyone know of summer undergraduate research type things in Europe or in the US that are open to international students?</p>",

Reference chasing has always been helpful. It can be hard to figure out what works are the most important/foundational at first but once you read a few papers you'll see the same works and authors cited over and over again. Reading ALL of those works is a good place to start. And take it seriously. It might seem like a lot of effort but getting the foundation down pat always pays off long term. <br>\nCold emailing grad students who are also working on similar problems for clarification on things from their published works has also been pretty fruitful. It can be daunting at first, but more often than not, they've been more than happy to respond.</p>",

As far as approaching professors at the schools you have in mind, you usually won't need to do this.  Few schools will <em>require</em> you to do it.  In fact, many professors don't like to be contacted by prospective students who haven't been admitted yet (they only want to talk to you once you're admitted), although it depends on the professor.  I stressed out a lot about cold-emailing professors when I was applying to grad schools, and I don't think I gained anything by doing it.  My time would have been better spent working on my application materials.</p>",

I rarely got all the technical parts, but if I understood the motivation for 1-2 of their recent papers and express why I thought it was cool, I decided I had an email! (Maybe as a note: this is in pure math where it's very accepted that you won't get all the details after reading a paper.)</p>\n<p>I was recommended for admission at Brown this way (note: the assistant prof in question knew of my supervisor, and I ultimately did not get in), and got my current European grant / current job by approaching an assistant professor who  my supervisor knew and who was looking for student. I don't think they talked until I got the grant though. He helped me a lot with the application of said grant and I believe it was really critical in me getting it! This is Europe specific though: since the PhDs are really short and there isn't a core program, you tend to apply with a prof in mind already. </p>\n<p>In comparison, the advice from one of my supervisor was </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you can say something meaningful about their papers in an email, you're in good shape. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which would have definitely been too big of a time/energy sink for me. </p>\n<p>If you want to contact more senior profs, what's worked for me is to do it in the summer/very early Fall, as they don't get many emails then. I got a reply from a senior person this way, but I don't know what the outcome would have been since I ended up missing the deadline for that school <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>\n<p>Looking back, I would have asked for more advice/helped with the application from my recommenders, would have been more honest about my doubts with the application with them so they could help me word it better. I would definitely have spent more time polishing my application. As for contacting profs, maybe cold-email a couple senior ones early asking if they're looking for students, and if that window has passed only cold-email the assistant ones professors or post-docs. </p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>",

It's also somewhat important from a logistic sense, since you're required to RA or TA every semester in order to get funding, but if you're affiliated with a lab/prof, then RA is a given. Each lab has a physical space (a room with cubicles), so lab affiliation seems to influence where you'll spend most of your time and who you'll spend your time with day-to-day.</p>",

Do you regret getting a PhD? Do you regret not trying to stay in academia? </p>\n<p>I'm nearing the end of my PhD and I am very ready to leave academia. But I'm also having doubts about this due to sunk costs. If I leave, then what was the point of wasting my 20s not earning money? I sort of feel pressure to have \"something to show for it\" (like a halfway decent thesis). Some people say grad school was the best years of their lives and they made lifelong friends/partners. I do not feel this way, and I have even less friends now than when I started, so the social aspect was not a big win for me. I did get to visit some cool places (like Australia) for free, but most people travel the world not by getting papers accepted to conferences. At this point, I probably know a little bit more linear algebra and probability theory as a typical CS undergrad which I feel is one of the biggest wins, but I feel like there are more efficient ways to do this than getting a PhD (and a determined person can easily get to this point by working through a few textbooks). </p>\n<p>In other words, if my goal is not to become a professor, then it really feels like a PhD is an extremely suboptimal route to have taken. I'm not sure along which variables it is actually optimal? So I'm curious from those that are a few years out of the PhD, does it feel mostly like regrets, or do you look back on it as a worthwhile experience?</p>",

(For background: Aaron had a distinguished academic career, winning the SIGPLAN dissertation award and then doing a high-profile postdoc, before joining Mozilla to work on Rust.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>What is your view of the value of a PhD, particularly from the perspective of working at a company like Mozilla?</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure I can speak to Mozilla broadly, but as a member of the Rust team, the skills I gained in academia are indispensable. Being able to boil down a problem to its fundamental constraints, being able to communicate clearly in speech and writing, being able to pitch an idea, being confident that I can learn anything given enough time \u2014 these are skills I rely on every day. While it\u2019s true that I don\u2019t have the breadth of engineering experience that some of my amazing peers do, I feel that my academic background has given me complementary strengths that have made me an effective part of the team.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that everyone should go get a PhD, of course \u2014 just that what I learned in the process has yielded ongoing value, even outside of a traditional research setting.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If I want new students before then, the options are (1) finding existing students in the Ph.D. program who don't have an advisor for whatever reason, or are unhappy with their advisor; (2) finding existing students in the MS program who want to do research, and getting them to transfer to the Ph.D. program; (3) off-cycle recruiting.  I can also work with other people's students to some extent.  (I was told that one person had \"too many\" new students starting in the fall and that I should poach one of them, but that's really up to the student.)  I've also started having meetings with an interested undergrad.</p>\n<p>I think that working with a junior faculty member is in many ways less risky than working with someone more senior.  We're more \"hungry\", and we'll have more time to spend with you than a more senior person might.  (I was my advisor's first student (I fell into the \"existing Ph.D. student who needed an advisor because her advisor switched institutions\" category), and I had a good experience working with him even though it wasn't a perfect research fit -- I ended up getting a lot of technical mentorship from my co-authors at another institution, who I already knew through the community.)</p>",

I worked for 3 years and went to RC before going back to university for a PhD. I quit 10 months later and that was probably one of the best decisions I ever made. Note that I don't regret going in either, but probably because it took me only a few months to realize how toxic it was and that I had to get out of it. Not everyone I know has had that luxury. Most grad students don't know that it's okay to quit and you don't actually need that title to be employable or to do good work in the same areas, and that serves the system pretty well (and this doesn't even go into all the ones that had plenty of other reasons to feel like staying was the only option, like people on a visa). I do believe is possible to have a good experience as a PhD but I also think those are very rare and not enough to justify the rest of students that get crashed by the system, so I think it's important to draw attention to the toxicity of academia and to the fact that you do not need a PhD to work on interesting problems.</p>",

This is because getting rec letters only gets harder as time passes. So, one alternative path that a lot of people don't even realize is possible b/c nobody tells you it is possible is, if you feel that coming out of senior year of undergrad you have a strong application, then you can apply to grad schools and if you get offers, consider deferring them for a year. Then use that one year to try out industry. I think this is the best of both worlds: (a) if you decide to go to academia, then you've got a year extra of savings $$ which is great, and one year in the grad scheme of academia is nothing, and (b) if you decide that you really like industry, then you can just not go to grad school.</p>",

(I feel like everyone's research has so much more information than what can be presented in a poster, and not all of it is suited to be explained in the poster format.) </li>\n<li>What are common things that people can improve on? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks in advance :).</p>",

All of them also had more or less a clear idea of the area of CS research that they wanted to be in (pedagogy, security, etc.), which helped them narrow down professors/universities.

If you want to dive a little further into the tech hiring/management norms of different parts of the worlds of software, I'm happy to go into that in the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"26271\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/26271-engineering-management\">#engineering management</a> stream!</p>\n<p>OK, so it sounds like there aren't well-known \"these are well-run departments where students are treated well\" lists. At the very least I presume there is a whisper network where academics try to warn candidates/applicants about particular advisors who will be dangerously awful to work with and potentially cause their students to leave (or worse), either in general or for that specific candidate for demographic reasons.</p>\n<p>I spoke with a friend yesterday who's a professor in a different field -- <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"226784\">@Steven Shipman (they) (S2'19)</span>, a chemistry professor -- which gave me some insight that I'm chewing over but am having a hard time summarizing. In particular: the set of people who apply to, for instance, chemistry Ph.D. programs in the US each year is in the low thousands, which is meso-scale. Too few to have really robust supply-and-demand effects -- and lots of people do know each other and give each other advice -- but so many that there's no one everyone-knows-each-other dynamic.</p>",

I mostly know people at my school from the NLP research groups. Could be different in other departments.</p>\n<p>There's also a number of people in NLP research that did not have a CS background. I know multiple professors who studied linguistics, and grad students that studied choose from (linguistics, journalism, math, physics, cog-sci, movement of oceans).</p>\n<p>Here's some CS programs that could be interesting:<br>\n- UMass-Amherst: The CS program has an MS/PhD and a PhD-only track. PhD-only is for people that already have their MS. I don't know the numbers but sure someone in our dept does.<br>\n- CMU LTI (Lang. and Tech. Institute) - A bit opposite of UMass. The MS is fully-funded. Internships are not allowed or discouraged (you stay at school over the summer and work on research). The LTI PhD program has a strong representation from the MS program.</p>",

A CS Ph.D. is a weird thing to choose, and actually sticking around to finish it is an even weirder choice.</p>\n<p>Leaving that aside, it's still pretty hard to make a call about these sorts of things because the numbers are so small.  I was my advisor's first Ph.D. student, for instance -- there was no track record to look at.  Even a well-established person may have only ever advised, say, ten students.  And a given advisor is likely going to be miserable for some students to work with while being great for other students, not necessarily through any fault of theirs or the students, but just because of a mismatch in interests, an unlucky lapse in funding during a certain period of time, or whatever.</p>\n<p>Finally, at least in my community, there are some advisors that are well known in the community to be assholes, but nevertheless have managed to cultivate a great lab culture with an esprit de corps that I envy, where students build each other up and work together and support one another.  I couldn't in good faith tell someone not to join a program like that, because on the whole I think it's better for the students than joining a lab that has a non-asshole advisor, but no community to speak of.</p>",

Let\u2019s say that I\u2019m a prospective graduate student interested in operating systems and formal verification. The first thing I can do is select only those areas \u2014 now the site shows me the departments that have people who tend to publish heavily in conferences such as SOSP and CAV. Second, I can click on an individual department and see who the key players are in those areas. Third, I can go to these people\u2019s home pages, Google Scholar pages, etc. in order to see what they are specifically doing, and finally I can read their code and papers. I would argue that this is a fundamentally different use of a ranking system: the purpose is to guide me towards details that matter, not to hide everything behind a number.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I try to tell people I came to grad school because it \"seemed like a fun job, albeit a difficult one, but honestly what genuinely fun job isn't difficult at least some of the time\" because I observe that identifying first and foremost as a grad student (/Jedi/whatever) leads to a lot of heartache.</p>",

It's just something you have to do to get your union card to continue to work in academia.

The \"job fair\" framing makes sense if attendees know they want to go to grad school and are just trying to decide where to apply, but I think there are a lot of RCers who are still at the \"find out what CS grad school even is\" stage.</p>",

The discipline in general was very interesting to me (as it always was and still is), but when it came to \"supervisor shopping\" I found that what I was suggested was mostly \"meh\" (that is, I would have been interested to attend a talk about it, but not to dedicate most of my time to it). I tried to think of my own ideas but they were met with (probably very just) criticism that they were too grandiose and that I should abandon it. Eventually I ended with a course based M.Sc after a pause of about 5 years.</p>\n<p>I am going to start a new M.Sc next week. This time I chose a (somewhat) different subject, where I believe there will be a lot more opportunities for me to be passionate about the research.

Depending on the city, the $30k+ that you'd get can be comfortable-but-not-extravagant. </li>\n<li>If that's not enough $$, my NSF fellowship allowed work on the side if my graduate program allowed it, and my program thought that my side gig was <em>awesome</em>.

I would love to meet people\u00a0putting together studies on traffic or cognition or educational outcomes, and I bet it would serve me well to know how people in different fields think about research, since I'm sure my career will involve collaborating with urban planners or people from the DOE etc.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know of examples of cross-discipline classes like this? Or have experience sharing the methodology (not just the results) of your field with people from a different one?</p>\n<p>I guess in a sense RC is a space like that! <img alt=\":recursecenter:\" class=\"emoji\" src=\"https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13/emoji/images/66.png\" title=\"recursecenter\"> <span aria-label=\"octopus\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f419\" role=\"img\" title=\"octopus\">:octopus:</span></p>",

I hope it\u2019s helpful! Sorry in advance for the length\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>The social environment</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The #1 best thing for me socially/acadmically this spring has been being in a handful of <strong>group chats</strong> with other students. Therefore, I would encourage students to share their phone numbers, set up chat groups, or someone could even \u201cassign\u201d people to little groups of 4-6 that\u2019ll be in similar classes, just to have a group to vent to and support. We\u2019ve been using group chats to:<ul>\n<li>text if you\u2019re running late to class and want someone to catch you up, or text if you notice someone isn\u2019t in class and you want to check in on them</li>\n<li>keep a running list of questions about course content that someone can ask during class</li>\n<li>take notes during a small group discussion that anyone can reference later when back in the big group</li>\n<li>float ideas for final projects, research questions, blog posts</li>\n<li>check up on the status of cancelled classes, due dates that have changed, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>chat during class</strong> - it has been so valuable to have a smaller space to either be snarky or comment on something during class, or to flag topics to side-channel about when something is really interesting and class doesn\u2019t go as in-depth as you want</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Get off Zoom as much as possible!</strong> Video calls are exhausting and awful. Encourage people to call on the phone instead of video if they can, go on \u201cwalks together\u201d where you both walk and talk on the phone, write things to each other or for the bigger group.</li>\n<li>If you feel like you can be a sufficiently positive and effective facilitator, <strong>lean in to some of the existential questions</strong> that are inescapable in the world right now, and that grad school usually provokes anyways (ex. What are you interested in? What are you going to do with this degree? Does this work matter? Why? What\u2019s wrong with this field/discipline? What happens if I can\u2019t find a job?). In my opinion, that\u2019s something grad school is good at (classes provoke those questions, students are at a life transition where it makes sense to consider them, and people who have been in academia for longer tend to have strong opinions about all of it!), and it\u2019s better to tackle those questions and feelings with guidance and support, rather than alone.</li>\n</ul>",

Schools are working around this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for phd students who have research meetings, it seems this already qualifies as in-person coursework</li>\n<li>for students enrolled only in courses, there is discussion of various things including meeting once in person during the semester as a workaround to the visa rule</li>\n<li>universities were blind-sided by this, but seem to be taking it very seriously</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There will likely be updates over the next few days. Most students involved in research seem to be not impacted at all, although there are certainly students who are enrolled only in courses. It's great to see such a quick response from professors I know, and it makes me cautiously optimistic that this too shall pass.</p>\n<p>Some ML profs are discussing this on twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haldaume3/status/1280251322177069058\">https://twitter.com/haldaume3/status/1280251322177069058</a></p>\n<div class=\"inline-preview-twitter\"><div class=\"twitter-tweet\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/haldaume3/status/1280251322177069058\"><img class=\"twitter-avatar\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1273735981959729160/V2K06fzS_normal.jpg\"></a><p>Appears to apply even if your university is in \"hybrid\" mode, if _you_ in particular happen to only be taking online courses. Hopefully directed research counts as in person, but it will definitely take some university lawyers to try to figure this out. <a href=\"https://t.co/zEcFRy8Ki9\">https://twitter.com/ilyaraz2/status/1280218030488686593</a></p><span>- Hal Daum\u00e9 III (@haldaume3)</span></div></div>",

            "content": "<p>In my opinion, there are a smallish number of fairly concrete things that almost always improve academic-style talks: A) really actually pay attention to the time limit from your very first outline -- many talks either go way over time (rude), or are unevenly paced because they started out paced to go over time, then have to hurriedly cut content at the end (hard to follow, kind of anxiety-inducing for some viewers such as me).  B) most talks benefit from \"breadcrumbs,\" both visually on the slides and out loud: \"so that was a summary of some of our inspirations with this project, and now I'm going to talk about the methods,\" and the previous  slide said like \"Related Work\" in the top corner and then next one will say \"Methods: [subtopic]\" in the same place, in a subtle but readable font. C) every academic talk should have visible slide numbers, especially if there's any chance there will be Q&amp;A. D) Put as few words as possible on your slides -- for an audience member, trying to simultaneously hear/read your speaking alongside trying to read the slides can be stressful and distracting. The specific recommendation varies from field to field but I've seen \"at most 12 words\" batted around, and I honestly try to have at most five -- slides are for stuff that <em>can't</em> be said verbally.  And since you'll have very few words, it should be straightforward to E) make sure all your text is as legible as possible -- big font, good contrast, never rely on color to distinguish stuff.  F) If you have any leverage for it, agitate for real-time captioning and make sure to give your captioner a list of any fancy jargon terms you might need; if it's a recorded talk, transcript it yourself (I have technical tips for this if you need them). If you know your video will be displayed somewhere with captions right over it, try to leave the bottom parts of your slides clear for them. Lastly G) I said jargon in that last one, but honestly ideally cut out as much jargon as possible. This one is audience-specific as to what counts as jargon but like, nothing loses an audience member faster than straight-up language problems.</p>",

One more thing: as I mentioned above, my department has a speaking skills requirement; every first- and second-year has to give a talk, and they are \"graded\" (pass/fail) by the faculty. An interesting/useful thing about them is that there's a rubric with six criteria: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The talk conveyed the problem and why it is important.</li>\n<li>The talk conveyed why the problem/question is hard or mysterious and why current approaches or theories are insufficient.</li>\n<li>The talk conveyed what was novel about the approach taken or the results discovered.</li>\n<li>The talk convinced me that the research was executed well. </li>\n<li>The talk conveyed the Future Implications of the work presented.</li>\n<li>The communication was clear (slides, speaking, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I  have used this rubric before to help me reason through other talks, because I think these are pretty useful criteria for most talks, and some of them suggest specific ways of structuring it.  Within this specific context, I sometimes tell people to literally say the answer to some of the questions in so many words, like \"Our approach was novel in these two ways...\", which can feel cheesy but can really help that info stick in the minds of the faculty reviewers. Even outside of this context, I think this can be a winning tactic. :)</p>",

But the solution to that is probably not to have taken more classes in the past, but to be flexible. Accept the fact that you won't always have the expertise you wish you had in the moment and then to do your best to plug these holes. Otherwise you'd never get anything done <span aria-label=\"stuck out tongue\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f61b\" role=\"img\" title=\"stuck out tongue\">:stuck_out_tongue:</span></p>\n<p>Grades don't matter. But I'd say, try to devote enough time to classes in foundational technical classes to get something out of them. In the long run, the ideas do pop up again and again. It's easier to relearn something if you've put in the effort at some point in the past.<br>\nThe real interesting stuff happens in topics/seminar classes where the prof generally teaches the class as \"here are the cool ideas in this area according to me\". It's often the best way to get a prof's perspective on research, other than being in their group/lab/having regular conversations with them.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Also, to be clear, I am mostly talking about required classes above. So things like grad algorithms, discrete math, a grad level ML class, systems requirements, which basically teach you stuff that any senior CS student should have taken but maybe a bit more in depth.</p>",

When they were good, they were so much fun: learning new things is fun, doing homework is pretty fun because it's scoped problems that I should have been given the baseline knowledge to solve and the problems have known solutions, and maybe I could get together with classmates in a study group and gripe about how bad the class was etc. I also liked that they were an opportunity to interact with a bunch of different faculty.

While you may be assigned a grade, PhD courses are effectively pass/fail. A and B are passing, anything else is failing. I don't think my grades in grad school were ever ever relevant. I never heard anybody stressing about keeping a GPA up for a post-doc, or anything like that. Your publication record is miles more important.</li>\n<li>Purpose of courses? At their best, PhD level courses are a tour of one corner of a field from somebody who knows it very very well and has thought about the best way to introduce it. At their worst, they are a circular waste of time where courses are offered and you are forced to take them to satisfy the faculty's teaching requirement. Unlike Annie's experience, the coursework didn't do as much to help me gel with my cohort -- my labmate relationships were far more important. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>At CMU, I thought the courses were largely excellent. The lower-level / introductory grad classes did a really good job at covering the basics that anybody in robotics needs to be passingly familiar with: computer vision, machine learning, relevant math. The higher-level / more specialized ones varied more, though the department seemed to have a norm of well-organized courses.</p>\n<p>The one that stuck with me the most was actually the one that was probably the easiest: Robot Manipulation.  It was taught by the beloved department chair, and he was fantastic at sharing his fascination with the subject. I see the world differently than I did before the class, constantly noticing instances of where a human has performed a feat of whole-body manipulation that is entirely intractable to a robot. It also inspired my eventual thesis project.</p>\n<p>The worst one I took at CMU was taught by my advisor -- I had taken <em>his</em> advisor's version of the course as an undergrad, and told <em>my</em> advisor that I didn't think I needed to take it again. I was informed that in that case, it would be easy, and I needed to take it anyways. So, I did, and it was easy, and a waste of my time. (I was not a fan of my MS advisor, obviously.)</p>\n<p>At UT (in the geology department), the courses were mostly hoops to jump through. I found them way less well designed, and as a result, not a good use of my time. (I was actually warned about this coming in -- a graduating student told me that the courses wouldn't be up to my expectations, given the institutions I had previously attended.) The exceptions were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A field course, where I got practical exposure to a bunch of different instruments. Designed and executed very well.</li>\n<li>A course on potential fields, that was ploddingly and uninspiringly taught but very competently designed. I used the math I learned in that course very directly when planning an aerogeophysical survey. A student who hadn't grokked the material as well struggled and basically failed at the same task.</li>\n<li>A course on digital signal processing, taught by the EE department. This was more of an undergrad level course with a graduate option (added some homework problems + requirement for a course project). I learned a lot that was directly applicable to the instruments I was working with, and my course project ended up with me figuring out how to lower the noise threshold on years of my group's data by ~10dB.</li>\n</ul>",
