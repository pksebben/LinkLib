My partner and I sent her listings we were interested in and she took us to see 'em. We did ask about several listings on 591 but they all fell through (not sure how hard she tried to set them up, though). Agent fee was half the monthly rent, which seems to be standard based on what I see other folks asking for on 591. We're paying something like $2,400 for a furnished two bedroom on the 11th floor in a 5--10 year old building near 101; there were cheaper places but we decided we wanted to live in a dense part of town and in a new/clean place.</p>",

I'm very gratified to see that there are good RC people interested in Taiwan. Taiwan has been my alternate spiritual home since I first came here in 1984. But, I must admit, it never occurred to me to start such a stream on Zulip.</p>\n<p>We live in an apartment hotel dating back to the 1980s. It caters heavily to Japanese expats employed here, and over the years we have found that Japanese expats and tourists in various countries tend to have really excellent information about resources, where the good food is, and so forth. So that would be my general recommendation \u2014 see if you can get access to information designed for Japanese long-term residents.</p>\n<p>Our initial information about this place came from a Taiwanese friend in her sixties who has stayed here, and there certainly are natives of the country living here, many of whom are fluent in American English. Like us, the building is in late middle age and rather stodgy, so it might not be the kind of place for young RC people. But it's well located and is properly staffed, two key considerations for us.</p>",

East Asian societies are vastly more bureaucratic than any part of America's is, even byzantine New York. So if you're acting in the role of foreigner, the intrinsic \"face\" of that role will eventually get you past the various hurdles. Sometimes hurdles are erected merely to slow down your progress. The smoothest way through is by persisting but  never abandoning your prestigious role as honored visitor. Losing your temper will damage that prestige rapidly.</p>",

They'll give you a receipt, an official embassy-level document, that you can show if your passport is demanded by officials in the interim. But getting a visa often means leaving your passport for a while, even if you visit in person. I got my last visa to Taiwan while in Japan in January, and they held the passport for a day or two while they prepared and inserted the visa. During that time, I carried the receipt, along with my own photocopies of the identity-page and the Japanese entry stamp.</p>\n<p>In 1992, when YSJ and I were going to China for a years-long research trip, they held our passports for so long that we eventually had to ask someone who had contacts in the embassy to check up on them for us.</p>",

I assume that's considered taxable foreign income in the US; my accountant is apparently still in a state of prostration after meeting the 15 October late-filing deadline and has ignored my question about the issue.</p>\n<p>I was able to get vouchers over the summer.

I was allowed to be out of the country for up to thirty days during that time, but those days would not count toward the six months. So I could have been in-country for two months, away for a week, in-country for another three months, away for another three weeks, and then in-country again for another month \u2014 and then my six months of residence would have been satisfied.</p>\n<p>For the visa, the TECO office in Japan didn't hold my passport more than a day or maybe it was two. The visa is affixed into the passport, which is why they require you to leave it.</p>\n<p>The ARC is not \u2014 it's a separate card, just like a US driver's license card..

            "content": "<p>I submitted my last round of forms on Friday in person at the NY TECO, and got a confirmation email Sunday night saying that my application \"has been officially approved, and is now entering the certificate stage.\" Woohoo!</p>\n<div class=\"spoiler-block\"><div class=\"spoiler-header\">\n<p>Detailed account of visiting NY TECO</p>\n</div><div class=\"spoiler-content\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<p>On Thursday I was preparing my passport docs (getting a notarized copy of passport, printing the passport submission form), planning to bring them to the TECO on Friday and drop them at the front desk. But that afternoon I got a call asking me to come in for an appointment to submit my passport. What a coincidence! I said i was free anytime, she said anytime tomorrow 9-4 was good, I said how about 9, she said actually how about 10, I said sounds great thank you.</p>\n<p>On Friday I got together all my documents (notarized copy of passport, printed passport submission notice from the application website, and actual passport), put on a collared shirt, and went to NY TECO. I also wore a regular surgical mask (I often wear a cloth mask or an N95 around depending on the risk level of where I am, but I figured it would be good to be wearing the standard/official thing for this visit). When I walked in, there was a temperature checking device right by the door, so I went over to that. It was rainy and cold so my glasses were fogged up and I could barely see anything, but I was able to figure it out after a minute. The device gave me an \"ok\" beep so I went over to the hand sanitizer across from it... which also gave me trouble haha. Eventually it dispensed some. There were two men in the lobby, one behind a desk by the entrance and one standing around.  I walked over to the desk and said I had an appointment at 10am for a gold card application, the guy at the desk shuffled some papers around, asked for my name and some ID, and then gave me a little ticket. The other guy took me up in the elevator. He asked me what I was doing, I said applying for a Gold Card. </p>\n<p>The elevator arrived at the 4th floor and the guy walked me over to a help desk-type area where another guy was working on something. I stood there and waited for a few minutes while the guy at the desk did other stuff. While I was waiting I got out my documents. After about 7 minutes-ish, he turned to me and asked my name and if I had an appointment. After a bit of misunderstanding / back and forth, he found my name on a sheet of paper and asked for my documents. I handed him all of them, incl the hard copy of the passport and explained that I had both a notarized copy and the hard copy, they could take whichever they preferred. He checked some things, nodded, and then started doing stuff with my papers. I had thought he would be taking my papers and dismissing me, but after a minute he said it'll be half an hour why dont I sit down and wait. I went over to the sitting area, got out my kindle and read. The guard who had taken me up from the lobby was standing around. While I was waiting another two applicants showed up separately. One woman he seemed to know and joked with her like they were friends; one woman seemed very flustered and a bit huffy, and he explained something to her about her application. </p>\n<p>After about 15min, a man walked out and called my name. He said I didnt need to wait here for my gold card, that it would take a few weeks and I should go home and they'll email me when it's ready. I tried to clarify that I wasn't expecting my gold card today but I think we kind of missed each other / didn't quite understand each other. After that first try I just enthusiastically/politely nodded, agreed, thanked him, etc. He introduce himself at the end as Thomas. He gave me back my passport submission notice and my passport. I walked over to the elevator and asked the guard if he needed to escort me down or if I should call the elevator. He joked with me about whether I needed an escort and we both laughed. When I got to the lobby I thanked the desk guard as I left.</p>\n<p>The visit took about half an hour, all told. There were a lot of miscommunications, I had trouble understanding people and vice versa; I think partly due to general language barriers (of course... my inability to speak any Mandarin) but also due to masks muffling people's voices. Everyone seemed quite friendly, and I think it went well overall</p>\n</div></div>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"850\">@David P Branner (SP2'17)</span> I really appreciated your posts here about Taiwan and about the TECOs; it was very helpful for thinking about how to approach the visit and thinking in advance about how to comport myself while on the visit.

It's not aimed at you personally. Sometimes the best way to identify someone who has an \"issue\" is just to get them talking and see what they say. You may have noticed that principle in play during campaigning for the American election this past summer and fall.</p>\n<p>Of course embassies are concerned about people with hidden motives getting visas or residency. Taiwan has a big, powerful enemy that would certainly not hesitate to make use of foreign nationals within Taiwan.</p>\n<p>When I first came to Taiwan, the process was less open and everyone had to apply for a visa. As part of the process, they asked me orally if I had ever lived in the People's Republic of China or in any authoritarian country. I mentioned being in Franco's Spain in 1971. That secured me an invitation to lunch, one-on-one, with an official at a fancy Chinese restaurant. He ordered a nice meal, and then asked me more about the visit. \"My father was an art historian, and in 1971 we visited Madrid for a few days. I was nine.\"</p>\n<p>It was clearly not what he had thought. We chatted a bit, and then the official excused himself and that was the end of the interview. I finished the lunch on my own.</p>",
